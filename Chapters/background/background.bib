@article{Bowmaker1980,
abstract = {1. Microspectrophotometric measurements have been made of the photopigments of individual rods and cones from the retina of a man. The measuring beam was passed transversely through the isolated outer segments. 2. The mean absorbance spectrum for rods (n = 11) had a peak at 497.6 +/- 3.3 nm and the mean transverse absorbance was 0.035 +/- 0.007. 3. Three classes of cones were identified. The long-wave cones ('red' cones) had a lambda max of 562.8 +/- 4.7 nm (n = 19) with a mean transverse absorbance of 0.027 +/- 0.005. The middle-wave cones ('green' cones) had a lambda max of 533.8 +/- 3.7 nm (n = 11) with a mean transverse absorbance of 0.032 +/- 0.007. The short-wave cones ('blue' cones) had a lambda max of 420.3 +/- 4.7 nm (n = 3) with a mean transverse absorbance of 0.037 +/- 0.011. 4. If assumptions are made about the length of cones and about pre-receptoral absorption, it is possible to derive psychophysical sensitivities for the cones that closely resemble the appropriate pi mechanisms of W. S. Stiles. 5. If assumptions are made about the length of rods and about pre-receptoral absorption, however, the psychophysical sensitivity derived for the rods is considerably broader than the C.I.E. scotopic sensitivity function.},

@article{Jameson2001,
abstract = {Traditional color vision theory posits that three types of retinal photopigments transduce light into a trivariate neural color code, thereby explaining color-matching behaviors. Thisprinciple of trichromacy is in need of reexamination in view of molecular genetics results suggesting that a substantial percentage of women possess more than three classes of retinal photopigments. At issue is the question of whether four-photopigment retinas necessarily yield trichromatic color perception. In the present paper, we review results and theory underlying the accepted photoreceptor-based model of trichromacy. A review of the psychological literature shows that gender-linked differences in color perception warrant further investigation of retinal photopigment classes and color perception relations. We use genetic analyses to examine an important position in the gene sequence, and we empirically assess and compare the color perception of individuals possessing more than three retinal photopigment genes with those possessing fewer retinal photopigment genes. Women with four-photopigment genotypes are found to perceive significantly more chromatic appearances in comparison with either male or female trichromat controls. We provide a rationale for this previously undetected finding and discuss implications for theories of color perception and gender differences in color behavior.},

@article{Jordan19931495,
abstract = {We have examined the colour vision of 43 female subjects in the age range 30–59 yr of whom 31 were obligate carriers of various forms of colour deficiency and the rest were women who had no known colour-deficient relatives. In the case of all the carriers we established the phenotypes of their colour-deficient sons. As a group, carriers made significantly more errors on the Ishihara plates and showed enlarged matching ranges on the Nagel anomaloscope, but we could not replicate earlier reports of increased error scores on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test or of systematic shifts in Rayleigh match mid-points. We did find that the colour matches of carriers of deuteranomaly were significantly displaced from those of normals in a ratio-matching task in which a mixture of 546 and 600 nm was matched with a mixture of 570 and 690 nm. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, women who are heterozygous for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae and we ask whether this affords them an extra dimension of colour vision, by analogy to New World monkeys where heterozygous females gain trichromacy in a basically dichromatic species. Many carriers of anomalous trichromacy exhibited no evidence for tetrachromacy, in that they accepted large-field Rayleigh matches following a rod bleach and they were unable to set unique matches in our ratio-matching task. However, eight carriers of anomalous trichromacy—and no other subject—refused large-field Rayleigh matches; and we found one carrier of deuteranomaly who was apparently able to make unique matches in the ratio-matching task. },

abstract = {We find that additivity of trichromatic color matches holds, even in parafoveal vision, for most observers if rods are prevented from seeing the stimuli. Some heterozygous women are exceptions. The failure of the additivity law for these women implies that their eyes contain more than three types of cone with different spectral sensitivities.},
