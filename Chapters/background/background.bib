abstract = {Hubel {\&} Wiesel classified primary visual cortex (V1) neurons as either simple, with responses modulated by the spatial phase of a sine grating, or complex, i.e. largely phase invariant. Much progress has been made in understanding how simple cells develop, and there are now detailed computational models establishing how they can form topographic maps ordered by orientation preference. There are also models of how complex cells can develop using outputs from simple cells with different phase preferences, but no model of how a topographic orientation map of complex cells could be formed based on the actual connectivity patterns found in V1. Addressing this question is important, because the majority of existing developmental models of simple-cell maps group neurons selective to similar spatial phases together, which is contrary to experimental evidence, and makes it difficult to construct complex cells. Overcoming this limitation is not trivial, because mechanisms responsible for map development drive receptive fields of nearby neurons to be highly correlated, while co-oriented receptive fields of opposite phases are anti-correlated. In this work, we model V1 as two topographically organised sheets representing cortical layer 4 and 2/3. Only layer 4 receives direct thalamic input. Both sheets are connected with narrow feed-forward and feedback connectivity. Only layer 2/3 contains strong long-range lateral connectivity, in line with current anatomical findings. Initially all weights in the model are random, and each is modified via a Hebbian learning rule. The model develops smooth, matching, orientation preference maps in both sheets. Layer 4 units become simple cells, with phase preference arranged randomly, while those in layer 2/3 are primarily complex cells. To our knowledge this model is the first explaining how simple cells can develop with random phase preference, and how maps of complex cells can develop, using only realistic patterns of connectivity.},

abstract = {Plant neurobiology, a new and developing area in the plant sciences, is a meeting place for scientists concerned with exploring how plants perceive signs within their environment and convert them into internal electro-chemical ('plant neurobiological') signals. These signals, in turn, permit rapid modifications of physiology and development that help plants adjust to changes in their environment. The use of the epithet 'neurobiology' in the context of plant life has, however, led to misunderstanding about the aims, content, and scope of this topic. This difficulty is possibly due to the terminology used, since this is often unfamiliar in the context of plants. In the present article, the scope of plant neurobiology is explored and some of analogical and metaphorical aspects of the subject are discussed. One approach to reconciling possible problems of using the term 'plant neurobiology' and, at the same time, of analysing information transfer in plants and the developmental processes which are regulated thereby, is through Living Systems Theory (LST). This theory specifically directs attention to the means by which information is gathered and processed, and then dispersed throughout the hierarchy of organisational levels of the plant body. Attempts to identify the plant 'neural' structures point to the involvement of the vascular tissue - xylem and phloem - in conveying electrical impulses generated in zones of special sensitivity to receptive locations throughout the plant in response to mild stress. Vascular tissue therefore corresponds, at the level of organismic organisation, with the informational 'channel and net' subsystem of LST. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Researchers have used a very wide range of different experimental and theoretical approaches to help understand mammalian visual systems. These approaches tend to have quite different assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses. Computational models of the visual cortex, in particular, have typically implemented either a proposed circuit for part of the visual cortex of the adult, assuming a very specific wiring pattern based on findings from adults, or else attempted to explain the long-term development of a visual cortex region from an initially undifferentiated starting point. Previous models of adult {\{}V1{\}} have been able to account for many of the measured properties of {\{}V1{\}} neurons, while not explaining how these properties arise or why neurons have those properties in particular. Previous developmental models have been able to reproduce the overall organization of specific feature maps in V1, such as orientation maps, but are generally formulated at an abstract level that does not allow testing with real images or analysis of detailed neural properties relevant for visual function. In this review of results from a large set of new, integrative models developed from shared principles and a set of shared software components, I show how these models now represent a single, consistent explanation for a wide body of experimental evidence, and form a compact hypothesis for much of the development and behavior of neurons in the visual cortex. The models are the first developmental models with wiring consistent with V1, the first to have realistic behavior with respect to visual contrast, and the first to include all of the demonstrated visual feature dimensions. The goal is to have a comprehensive explanation for why {\{}V1{\}} is wired as it is in the adult, and how that circuitry leads to the observed behavior of the neurons during visual tasks.},

The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.},

We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.},

At issue is the question of whether four-photopigment retinas necessarily yield trichromatic color perception. In the present paper, we review results and theory underlying the accepted photoreceptor-based model of trichromacy. A review of the psychological literature shows that gender-linked differences in color perception warrant further investigation of retinal photopigment classes and color perception relations. We use genetic analyses to examine an important position in the gene sequence, and we empirically assess and compare the color perception of individuals possessing more than three retinal photopigment genes with those possessing fewer retinal photopigment genes. Women with four-photopigment genotypes are found to perceive significantly more chromatic appearances in comparison with either male or female trichromat controls. We provide a rationale for this previously undetected finding and discuss implications for theories of color perception and gender differences in color behavior.},

In the case of all the carriers we established the phenotypes of their colour-deficient sons. As a group, carriers made significantly more errors on the Ishihara plates and showed enlarged matching ranges on the Nagel anomaloscope, but we could not replicate earlier reports of increased error scores on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test or of systematic shifts in Rayleigh match mid-points. We did find that the colour matches of carriers of deuteranomaly were significantly displaced from those of normals in a ratio-matching task in which a mixture of 546 and 600 nm was matched with a mixture of 570 and 690 nm. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, women who are heterozygous for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae and we ask whether this affords them an extra dimension of colour vision, by analogy to New World monkeys where heterozygous females gain trichromacy in a basically dichromatic species. Many carriers of anomalous trichromacy exhibited no evidence for tetrachromacy, in that they accepted large-field Rayleigh matches following a rod bleach and they were unable to set unique matches in our ratio-matching task. However, eight carriers of anomalous trichromacy—and no other subject—refused large-field Rayleigh matches; and we found one carrier of deuteranomaly who was apparently able to make unique matches in the ratio-matching task.},

Functional brain imaging in humans was used to study the neural basis of these subjective perceptual changes. Cortical regions whose activity reflected perceptual transitions included extrastriate areas of the ventral visual pathway, and parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in spatial attention; whereas the extrastriate areas were also engaged by nonrivalrous perceptual changes, activity in the frontoparietal cortex was specifically associated with perceptual alternation only during rivalry. These results suggest that frontoparietal areas play a central role in conscious perception, biasing the content of visual awareness toward abstract internal representations of visual scenes, rather than simply toward space.},

At each stage (unilateral parieto-preoccipital removal, contralateral striate removal and posterior callosal transection) the monkeys were tested for retention of the landmark task, a visuospatial discrimination sensitive to the effects of bilateral parieto-preoccipital damage. To check the effectiveness of the disconnection, the monkeys were also tested after removal of the remaining parieto-preoccipital cortex. The results demonstrated that corticocortical inputs from striate cortex are crucial for the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex, just as they had been shown earlier to be crucial for the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex. Relative to inferior temporal cortex, however, parieto-preoccipital cortex was found to be especially dependent on ipsilateral (as compared with contralateral) striate inputs. In Experiment 3, monkeys received bilateral lesions of either lateral or medial striate cortex and were tested on both a pattern discrimination task, to assess residual inferior temporal function, and the landmark task, to assess residual parieto-preoccipital function. The results indicated that the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex are especially dependent on inputs from lateral striate cortex, whereas the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex are equally dependent on inputs from lateral and medial striate cortex. The relatively greater contribution to parieto-preoccipital than to inferior temporal cortex made by ipsilateral and medial striate inputs (representing contralateral and peripheral visual fields, respectively) can also be seen in the receptive field properties of parieto-preoccipital and inferior temporal neurons. The differences in the organization of striate inputs to these two cortical association areas presumably reflect differences in the processing required for spatial vs object vision.},

@article{Shepherd2012,
abstract = {If biology throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was dominated by the metaphor of the machine, the metaphor underlying twenty first century biology is that of the network or web. A rapid proliferation of molecular data coupled with increased computational power has revealed that gene regulation, protein interaction, the topology of metabolism and signal-transduction in and between cells, tissues, organs and organisms can all be described as robust, resilient and modular networks. Such small-world networks are characterised by rapid signal propagation, a capacity for computation and for synchronisation between the same, or different, hierarchic levels. Organelles, cells, tissues, organisms and ecosystems are not mere aggregations of components, but are hierarchies of interacting systems or modules, each possessing a degree of autonomy, and each a degree of interdependence. Into this metaphor of the network has emerged the discipline of integrative plant electrophysiology, called by its adherents, plant neurobiology. This field aims to understand how plants perceive, recall and process experience, coordinating behavioural responses via integrated information networks that include molecular, chemical and electrical levels of signalling. Integrative plant electrophysiology rejects the long standing view of plants as passive insensate automata that react to the environment with mechanical simplicity. The controversial use of the word ‘neurobiology' as applied to plants signifies that long-distance electrical signals, such as action potentials, convey meaningful information from the site of initiation to a distant site, where the signal is interpreted and evaluated, and an adaptive behavioural response is mounted. Such inter-module communication is ‘nervous' in the sense that it is adaptive, thereby implying capacities for memory, learning, anticipating the future and for generating novel responses. By itself a touch stimulus is meaningless, and by itself a behaviour (e.g. Mimosa leaf folding) is meaningless. Meaning lies in the network of processes that associate and integrate these events. Communication processes within, and between plants and associated organisms, can therefore be considered as biosemiotic, involving as they do the interpretation and evaluation of stimuli. This review traces historical aspects of the development of integrative plant electrophysiology and the methods that inform it, with a special emphasis on the work of Indian biophysicist Sir J. C. Bose (1858–1937), who, in an impressive body of published research, proposed that plants and animals share essentially similar fundamental physiological mechanisms. The first scientist to appreciate that responses in plants (e.g. leaf folding in the sensitive plant Mimosa ) constitute behaviour reliant on integrative electrical signals; Bose argued further that all plants co-ordinate their movements and integrate their responses to the world through electrical signalling. Despite their sessile habits, plants are to be regarded as sensate, active, intelligent explorers of the world. Bose identified a fundamental physiological motif that interlinked measurable pulsations or oscillations in cellular electric potentials with oscillations in cell turgor pressure, cellular contractility and growth. All plants respond to the world and to other living things through adaptations of this pulsatile motif, an electromechanical pulse that underlies electro-osmotically enacted behaviour. J.C. Bose's conclusions that all plants possess a nervous system, a form of intelligence, and a capacity for remembering and learning, were poorly received by prominent electrophysiologists of his time. Experiments devoted to plant responsiveness, inter-organism communication, kin-recognition, foraging, intelligence and learning as mediated by electrical signalling, are now published and debated in the mainstream literature as aspects of integrative plant electrophysiology.},

Multistable phenomena permit dissociation of neural activity related to conscious perception from that related to sensory stimulation, and therefore have been used extensively to study the neural correlates of consciousness. Here, we review recent work on the neural mechanisms underlying multistable perception and how such work has contributed to understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. Particular emphasis is put on the role of high-level brain mechanisms that are involved in actively selecting and interpreting sensory information, and their interactions with lower-level processes that are more directly concerned with the processing of sensory stimulus properties.},

abstract = {Development of orientation maps in ferret and cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to be stable, in that the earliest measurable maps are similar in form to the eventual adult map, robust, in that similar maps develop in both dark rearing and in a variety of normal visual environments, and yet adaptive, in that the final map pattern reflects the statistics of the specific visual environment. How can these three properties be reconciled? Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results. Specifically, contrast-gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {What, if anything, is the functional significance of spatial patterning in cortical feature maps? We ask this question of four major theories of cortical map formation: self-organizing maps, wiring optimization, place coding, and reaction-diffusion. We argue that (i) self-organizing maps yield spatial patterning only as a by-product of efficient mechanisms for developing environmentally appropriate distributions of feature preferences, (ii) wiring optimization assumes rather than explains a map-like organization, (iii) place-coding mechanisms can at best explain only a subset of maps in functional terms, and (iv) reaction-diffusion models suggest two factors in the evolution of maps, the first based on efficient development of feature distributions, and the second based on generating feature-specific long-range recurrent cortical circuitry. None of these explanations for the existence of topological maps requires spatial patterning in maps to be useful. Thus despite these useful frameworks for understanding how maps form and how they are wired, the possibility that patterns are merely epiphenomena in the evolution of mammalian neocortex cannot be rejected. The article is intended as a nontechnical introduction to the assumptions and predictions of these four important classes of models, along with other possible functional explanations for maps. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) drive circadian-clock resetting, pupillary constriction, and other non-image-forming photic responses. Both the light responses of ipRGCs and the behaviors they drive are remarkably sustained, raising the possibility that, unlike rods and cones, ipRGCs do not adjust their sensitivity according to lighting conditions (?adaptation?). We found, to the contrary, that ipRGC sensitivity is plastic, strongly influenced by lighting history. When exposed to a constant, bright background, the background-evoked response decayed, and responses to superimposed flashes grew in amplitude, indicating light adaptation. After extinction of a light-adapting background, sensitivity recovered progressively in darkness, indicating dark adaptation. Because these adjustments in sensitivity persisted when synapses were blocked, they constitute ?photoreceptor adaptation? rather than ?network adaptation.? Implications for the mechanisms generating various non-image-forming visual responses are discussed.},
