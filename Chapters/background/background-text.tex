Sensitivity to the visual spectrum is an important survival trait for almost all land animals.
Whether predator or prey, the ability to see allows an individual organism to receive and perceive information about their environment over large distances.

\subsection{The central nervous system}

The central nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and retina.
Within each, there are specialised biological cells called neurons, whose properties allow them to encode information about the external world gleamed through the body's sensory organs, manipulate this information and perform computations with it in order to control the behaviour of the body.%
\footnote{
Neurons are common across all species of animals, though the architecture of their nervous systems vary greatly.
Plants are also able to infer properties of their environment and respond accordingly using chemical and electrical signals, despite their lack of neurons.
}
The peripheral nervous system and the retina together provide a stream of data about the environment within which the subject resides, known as the \termemph{senses} (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, temperature, pressure, \textit{etc.}).
The computations performed by the central nervous system allow it to extract features from this stream of sensory information, store properties of it for later computational use, and decide behavioural actions to perform   computations using it in order to decide how best to interact with its environment and which actions to perform within it.\citep{TEDWolpert}

Information transmission between neurons is principally mediated by changes in the voltage, or potential difference, between the inside and the outside of the neuron.
The change in voltage within one neuron propagates along its cell to affect other neurons which make direct conductive connections with it.
However, the majority of connections between neurons are indirect, with a synaptic junction between the output of one neuron and the input to the next.

\subsection{The eye}

The story of visual perception begins with the eye.
As such a useful sensory organ, eyes have evolved multiple times.
We are concerned with the mammalian visual system, and as such describe the properties of the eye common as it is in humans and other mammals.

For any visual system, the most fundamental component is a set of cells which are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.
In mammals (and the rest of the class), the light-sensitive cells, or photoreceptors, come in two types: rods and cones.%
\footnote{Other photosensitive cells are present in mammals, but these are only used for subconcious modulation of circadian rhythms.}
Both rods and cones are sub-classes of neuron which contain photosensitive pigment.
When photons of light collide with the photopigment, the electrons in the pigment are elevated to higher orbital levels and the voltage across the photoreceptor changes.
However, the energy in the photon is indivisible and so the amount of energy which it contains must closely match the difference in energy levels between the electron orbitals for the photopigment.
Consequently each photopigment is only sensitive to a particular range of wavelengths of light.%
\footnote{The amount of energy within a photon is related to its wavelength according to the Planck--Einstein relation,
$E = h f$, where $E$ denotes the energy of a photon, $f$, the frequency associated with it, and $h$ is the Planck constant.% h = 6.626...\times 10^{âˆ’34}
}
Even when a photon does contain a suitable amount of energy, there is no guarantee that it will interact with an electron and it may pass straight through the photopigment.

Rod photoreceptors, which are broadly sensitive to the range of wavelengths $x-to-yHz$.
The voltage of the neuron changes readily when the photopigment is excited, so these cells are very sensitive to individual photons.
This makes them ideal for seeing in low lighting conditions.
However, in well-lit scenes, rods quickly become saturated, at which point they offer no information about the external world other than the fact that it is ``quite bright right now''.

Cone photoreceptors come in different types.
In humans, there are three types%
\footnote{With the exception of colour-blind individuals, who may have only two types of cones, and tetrachromats \citep{Nagy1981,Jordan1993,Jameson2001} who have four.}
of cones:
\acl{L}, \acl{M}, and \acl{S} (\acsu{L}, \acsu{M}, and \acsu{S}).
These can be approximately considered sensitive to red, green, and blue light respectively.
However, it should be noted that there is a broad range of wavelengths which each is sensitive to, and this range is very similar for the \ac{L} and \ac{M} cells.
Most of the rest of the mammalian class has only two cones, \ac{M} and \ac{S}, including cats, dogs, and some monkeys.
Other monkeys also have 3 cone types, but not necessarily with the same balance between the cone types as is apparent in humans \citep{Stockman2008}.
The membrane potential of the cone cells is not as sensitive as that of rods, and multiple photons need to interact with the neuron to get the same change in voltage.
This means cones are only useful in well-lit environments, where many photons can interact with the neuron in rapid succession.


\subsubsection{Bipolar and \aclp{RGC}}

Rods and cones are connected to bipolar cells, are also located in the retina of the eye.

These feed into \acp{RGC}, which detect centre-surround differences in colour, 

Research in animal models has shown there are a wide variety of .
Within the mouse, there are at least xxx different xxx cells, detecting directed motion etc.
It is not currently clear how many of these distinct subclasses of neurons are present in humans.
They seem to be more common in mice than humans because higher order mammals have the cortical capacity to perform such functions in higher brain regions.

This in turn changes the voltage of neurons connected to the photoreceptor.

\section{Information Theory, and its applications within Neuroscience}
\label{sec:bgit}

A common experimental methodology used in neuroscience is to record the extracellular activity of individual neurons under different conditions.
From this, we can compare the activity of the neuron under different conditions to examine whether it is dependent on this set of conditions, and if so investigate the nature of the relationship between the two.

Frequently, the approach used is to take many recordings of the same neuron for the same condition, and then take the average across these repetitions (``trials'') to reduce the effects of neuronal variability, producing a \ac{PSTH}, for instance.
This neuronal variability is often referred to as ``noise'', however it is debatable as to whether differences in the behaviour of individual neurons between trials are due to noise within the system or are in fact representative of changes in other, as-yet unknown, hidden or latent variables within the system (see \autoref{sec:bg-noisecorr} for further discussion).

Such a simple treatment of the data --- averaging over the response over repetitions --- is fundamentally flawed, since this is not the manner in which brains process stimuli.
At any moment in time, the brain has access to the activity of many neurons simultaneously (not a single neuron in isolation), but only has a single sample of each one (not multiple instantiations of the same neuron).

If we instead use information theory to study the neuronal activity, we can consider how much information there is across a system containing multiple neurons during an isolated period of time, for instance a single trial.
By using an information theoretic technique, we can overcome the limitations of the more simple methods; but no method is perfect and there are other limitations which arise when using information theory instead.
% CITE no free lunch theorem
In this section, I will first outline the analytic procedure through which information theoretic analysis is applied to neuroscientific data, some of the problems which arise, and how to try to overcome them.


\subsection{Neuroscientific context}

In the context of trying to experimentally investigate properties of the sensory cortex of the brain, one typically uses an experimental set-up with a finite collection of discrete experimental stimuli.
These stimuli are then repeatedly presented to the sensory organ in an appropriate fashion, and the responses during each presentation are recorded.

% Can cut the Fisher information, since it isn't actually information theoretic
Even when investigating the responses to stimulus features which vary continuously, such as line orientation for the visual stimulation and frequency for auditory stimulation, one has two options.
Firstly, the features can be preserved in a continuous space and the information about the stimulus estimated using Fisher information. The inverse of the Fisher information provides a lower bound on the mean squared error which any decoder can achieve \citep{Quiroga2009}.
Alternatively, the stimulus space can be discretized into a finite subset of stimuli from which we can draw samples with repetition.
Once the samples are discretized and presented repeatedly, we can use Shannon information to compute the amount of information about the stimulus identity contained in the neuronal response.
If the stimulus set is intrinsically discrete, Fisher information can not be used and an information theoretic analysis can only be performed using Shannon information.

For such an experimental set-up, let us assume that on each trial some stimulus $s$ is selected at random, with probability $p(s)$, from a set of discrete stimuli $\SET{S}$.
The random variable $S$ denotes this selection of a stimulus, with some arbitrary probability distribution across the elements of $\SET{S}$.
The neuronal response could be one (or more than one) of several data types, such as a spike train from one or more neurons, the \ac{LFP}, \ac{CSD}, \ac{BOLD} signal, a calcium indicator, \ac{EEG}, or others \citep{Magri2009,Quiroga2009}.
The principles of information theory can be applied whichever neural signal is taken to be the response.
In \autoref{ch:pl}, we will work with information encoded in \ac{MUA} and spike trains, whilst in Chapters~\ref{ch:lam} and \ref{ch:plam} we will be considering the \ac{LFP} and \ac{CSD}.

With regards to the analysis of sensory recordings (with which this thesis will be concerned), the different conditions used on the trial are typically different stimuli, and the extracellular recordings provide us with the neuron's response to the stimuli.
When applying information theory to neuronal data, we treat the brain as a communication channel, transmitting information about sensory input.
We are hence interested in how much information the response in the brain contains about which stimulus was presented to it.

However, it should be noted that we frame the problem in the context of a \termemph{communication channel} simply because this is the framework around which Shannon information is formulated \citep{mackay2003information}.
Within information theory, systems are modelled with information passing between a transmitter and receiver through a communication channel.
The message passing between them in modified as it passes through the channel, and the receiver must attempt to decipher which message was originally sent.

In some ways, some functions of the brain are similar to the process of a compression algorithm.
The initial encoding of the stimulus as transcribed by the appropriate sensory organ contains a large amount of information about the precise input stimulus --- for example the individual pixel values with an image stimulus --- which has a large amount of redundancy if one is interested only in detecting, classifying, and reacting to stimuli.
A binary image of only $17 \times 17$ pixels can express \num{9.9e86} different states --- around a million times more than there are atoms in the visible universe, thought to be around \num{1e80}.
However the vast majority of these images (for this, or equally true for a larger image with more intensity levels and colours) resemble unstructured random noise.
The set of images which are of interest for interacting with a real world environment is vastly smaller, and with an appropriate high-level statistical model of the appropriate subset of the class of all potential stimuli can be compressed down to a much smaller number of bytes.
For instance, whether a given visual stimulus contains the face of familiar person.

After a stimulus has been processed by the brain, information about the exact intensities of individual pixels is lost, but salient information about the environment is preserved.
We can hence investigate how stimuli are encoded within the brain by computing the amount of information about properties of the stimulus contained within the neural recordings.
Here, we make the following assumption: if the neuronal activity is observed to contain information about the stimulus, we can assume this information is present due to the manner within which information is encoded by the brain, and that this information can be drawn upon to inform decisions taken with regard to the stimulus.
We rationalise this assumption on the basis that we know the brain contains information about stimuli (otherwise it would be functionally blind/deaf), and it would be wasteful expend resources encoding stimuli accurately but in a non-functional manner.

The neural data which can be collected with modern experimental equipment is very dense and rich in content.
For instance, individual spikes can be recorded with the precision of fraction of a millisecond, and broadband \acp{LFP} allow for many frequency components to be analysed from the same recording.
Typically, it is not possible to compute the information about the stimulus contained in the entire data stream all at once.
The reason for this is the relatively small number of trials which can be collected for any given dataset.

% Mark dislikes this paragraph I guess?
The repetitions of presenting the same stimulus and recording the neural response must be performed with the experimental setup the same, and recording taken from the same neurons.
However, there is a maximum duration for any \invivo{} experiment of a few hours, after which the experimenters and subjects will be fatigued.
This, naturally, leads to a maximum number of repetitions of an experimental protocol which can be completed within this timeframe, and that is in the order of 100.
Should more trials be undertaken in a different experimental session, there is no guarantee that the neurons recorded from will be the same, so the response structure may be different and can't be combined with that of the prior session.

Using information theory, we can investigate the nature of the neural code used by individual neurons and populations of neurons \citep{Optican1987}.
For example, if our dataset consists of recordings of neuronal spiking activity, we can consider the amount of information contained in the spike train coincident with a \SI{40}{\milli\second} stimulus, say.
First, we can consider our response vector to be the total number of spikes over the \SI{40}{\milli\second} window and compute the information contained in these about the identity of the presented stimulus.
Second, we can consider our response vector to be the number of spikes in each quarter of the stimulus presentation period (four \SI{10}{\milli\second} windows).
This step could equally be performed with more windows of finer granularity, so in general we would have a response vector $r = [r_1, \ldots, r_L]$, with $L$ windows each of length $\nicefrac{T}{L}$ and $r_i$ the number of spikes during the $i$-th window\footnote{In our example, $T = \SI{40}{\milli\second}$.}.
Since the information contained in single \SI{40}{\milli\second} window approach is, by construction, contained in the vector of responses within the shorter windows, we can investigate amount of information contained within the timing of the spikes.
If there is no significant difference between the amount of information about the stimulus contained in the two vectors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the stimulus, or some attributes which distinguish it, are encoded in the firing rate, whilst the exact timing of the spikes is unimportant.

% Typically \citep{Quiroga2009,Brasselet2012,Panzeri2007,Arabzadeh2006,Strong1998}, a certain post-stimulus time window of duration $t$ in \SIrange{20}{40}{\milli\second} is chosen and a neural code is constructed which forms a discrete, multi-dimensional array $r = \{r_1, \ldots, r_L\}$ of dimension $L$, because a discrete response of this form is appropriate for performing an information theoretic analysis on.
% To look at the information given by the firing rate of a single neuron, we might use a spike-count code where $L=1$ and $r$ is equal to the number of spikes elicited in the window $t$.
% Similarly, to look at the information contained in the firing rate of a many neurons, we would use a spike-count code where $r_i$ is equal to the number of spikes elicited in the window $t$ for spike train of the \nth{i} neuron, and let $L$ equal the number of neurons to be studied.
% In comparison, to look at the information contained in the millisecond level spike timing of a single neurons, we would divide the time window into $L$ bins of length $\Delta t = \nicefrac{t}{L}$ such that $\Delta t$ is the assumed time precision of the code, and set $r_i$ to be the number of spikes elicited in \nth{i} time-bin.

In general, we will choose some framework through which the raw data is reduced to a manageable finite ensemble of possible states, $\SET{R}$.
Having constrained both our encoding of the stimulus and the response to a finite set of states, we can investigate the relationship between them using Shannon information \citep{Shannon1948}.


\subsection{Theoretical background to information theory}

Within the understanding of Shannon information, information is quantified in a manner analogous to how ``surprised'' a receiver would be if they were to reveal the contents of a message sent by the transmitter.
Unless there is only one possible message, there is uncertainty over what will be sent, potentially with some messages more likely than others.
If an \textit{a priori} likely message is received, this confirms the expectations so the receiver, so they are less ``surprised''.
If an unlikely message is received, the receiver is more ``surprised''.
Intuitively, the amount of information gained on receipt of the message is related to how much the uncertainty in the message was reduced upon its arrival.

Rigorously, we define the \termemph{Shannon information} content of an outcome or result $x$ to be
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:shannon-information}
\operatorname{h}(x) = \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x)}
.\end{equation}
This corresponds to how ``surprised'' we would be to observe the result $x$ being produced by the system in question.
Note that $h(x)=0$ if $p(x)=1$ (if an event is certain, we are never surprised and gain no information observing it), and $h(x) \to \infty$ as $p(x) \to 0^+$ (we gain more information --- we are increasingly surprised --- when a diminishingly unlikely event occurs).

The \termemph{entropy} of a system is a measure of amount of uncertainty we have about its state.
We define this as the expected amount of information we will gain when we observe it,
\begin{align}
\HH( X )
  &= \EE_X \left[ \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x)} \right] \notag
\\&= \sum_{x \in \SET{X}} p(x) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x)} \notag
\\&= - \sum_{x \in \SET{X}} p(x) \log_2 p(x)
,\end{align}
where $X$ is the ensemble of possible states of the system in question.

When studying neural recordings using information theory, we will need to take note of the uncertainty in which stimulus is presented, $\HH(S)$, and the uncertainty in the response, $\HH(R)$.
In particular, the amount of information about the stimulus contained in the response is their \termemph{mutual information}, $\I(S;R)$.
The mutual information is the amount by which our uncertainty in the stimulus is reduced when we discover the identity of the response to that stimulus, which is equivalent to the amount by which our uncertainty in the response decreases when we discover the identity of the stimulus.
In general, we can express the mutual information between two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, as
\begin{align}
\I(X;Y)
  &= \EE_{X, Y} \left[ \log_2 \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} \right] \notag
\\&= \sum_{x \in \SET{X}, \, y \in \SET{Y}} p(x,y) \, \log_2 \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} \notag
\\&= \HH(X) - \HH(X | Y) \notag
\\&= \HH(Y) - \HH(Y | X) \label{eq:info}
.\end{align}
For brevity, we will use the term \textemph{information} to refer to the mutual information between two random variables throughout this thesis, instead of the self-information defined in \autoref{eq:shannon-information}.

In \autoref{eq:info}, we make use of the conditional entropy, $\HH(X | Y)$.
This is so named because it is the entropy of one variable when conditioned on the state of another --- it is also referred to as the noise entropy, particularly when we consider the entropy of the response conditioned on the stimulus, $\HH(R|S)$.
Analogously to \autoref{eq:shannon-information}, conditional entropy is defined as
\begin{align}
\HH(X | Y)
  &= \EE_{X, Y} \left[ \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x|y)} \right] \notag
\\&= \sum_{x \in \SET{X}, \, y \in \SET{Y}} p(x,y) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x|y)} \notag
\\&= \sum_{y \in \SET{Y}} p(y) \sum_{x \in \SET{X}} p(x|y) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x|y)} \notag
\\&= - \sum_{y \in \SET{Y}} p(y) \sum_{x \in \SET{X}} p(x|y) \log_2 p(x|y)
.\end{align}
The Venn diagram shown in \autoref{fig:bg_info_venn} illustrates the relationship between the entropies of $X$ and $Y$, their joint entropy, conditional entropies, and mutual information, which may assist the reader in conceptualising the relationship between these terms.

The two black circles represent the entropies of $X$ and $Y$, $\HH(X)$ and $\HH(Y)$, and their total area (outlined in green) is the total joint uncertainty, $\HH(X, Y)$.
In the scenario depicted, $\HH(X)$ and $\HH(Y)$ are partially but incompletely redundant.
Consequently, the uncertainty of $X$ is reduced (but not expected to be zero) when $Y$ is known: the conditional entropy $\HH(X|Y)$ (red region) is smaller than $\HH(X)$, but is not empty.
The amount by which our expected uncertainty in $X$ is reduced, $\HH(X) - \HH(X|Y)$, is equivalent to the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$, denoted $\I(X;Y)$ and represented by the purple region.
We can reason similarly about the other conditional entropy, $\HH(Y|X)$ (blue region).

\subsection{Applying information theory in practice}

Computing the mutual information between stimulus and response requires us to estimate $p(s)$, $p(r)$, and either $p(s|r)$ or $p(r|s)$ for every possible stimulus, $s$, and response, $r$.
The requirement to know $p(s)$ renders applying mutual information outside of a controlled environment all-but impossible.
If the subject is free moving, a prior over the set of potential stimuli it could be exposed to is very challenging to define.
However, within an experimental setting we can control the stimulus presentation such that there is only a finite set of unique stimuli, and the probability of each of them, $p(s)$, is defined by our experimental protocol.
In practice, $p(r|s)$ is much easier to derive than $p(s|r)$, and so we estimate $p(r)$ and $p(r|s)$.
As mentioned earlier, we must repeatedly present each stimulus so it is possible to estimate the response distribution $p(r|s)$ for each stimulus condition.

However, estimating these probabilities from the data can cause problems with our estimated mutual information.
Since we have only a finite number of samples, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in our probability estimates (the ``limited sampling'' problem).
Should we repeat the experiment, the natural variation in the samples we collect will result in statistical variance in our measured mutual information.
Moreover, the variation due to finite sampling may cause our response distributions to appear different for different stimuli, even when the underlying response generation process is the same for each stimulus.
Such problems produce an over-estimation bias in the computed mutual information compared with the ground truth.
For instance, if a particular response never occurs for given stimulus presentation, a na{\"i}ve frequentist estimate of its probability would be $0$.
This would lead us to mistakenly conclude that it is impossible a certain stimulus was presented if we observe this response, even though we could have observed this combination had we taken more samples.

Of even greater concern, the bias to the estimated mutual information can vary greatly depending on the choice of experiment or analysis framework.
One cannot draw comparisons between na{\"i}vely estimated mutual information values under different experimental criteria because the changes in the bias can completely dwarf the changes in the ground truth information value.
It is therefore necessary to estimate the bias on the na{\"i}ve mutual information value and make a correction to counteract it.


\subsection{Bias correction}
\label{sec:info-bias}

A number of techniques exist to correct for the bias in the mutual information estimation.
The simplest of these is to shuffle the data so that responses are paired with stimuli at random \citep{Optican1991}.
Unfortunately, this will often be a poor estimate of the bias \citep{Panzeri1996}, because there may be responses which never occur with certain stimuli.
Pairing stimuli and responses together at random inflates the set of unique responses to each stimulus above what is possible in practice, and as a consequence an estimate of the bias determined in this manner will be a pessimistic overestimate.

However, for a multi-dimensional response (where each stimulus presentation produces a response vector), shuffling provides an invaluable bias-correction technique.
Using the methodology of \citet{Montemurro2007}, we add an additional step to compute the noise entropy under the simplifying assumption that each dimension of $r$ is independent of the others.
Exploiting this, we have
\begin{equation}
p_\text{ind}([r_1,r_2,r_3,\cdots]|s) = p(r_1|s) \, p(r_2|s) \, p(r_3|s) \, \cdots
\end{equation}
and can can compute $\HH_\text{ind}( R | S )$ directly from estimates of each $p(r_i|s)$ derived from the data.
This has very little bias compared with $\HH( R | S )$ there are so many more samples --- the ratio of samples for unique response vectors to individual response elements rises exponentially with the dimension of the response vector.
One can alternatively estimate this entropy from pseudo-response arrays by shuffling each element in the response vector conditioned on the stimulus, producing $\HH_\text{sh}( R | S )$.
Since this shuffling destroys information contained in the dependencies between elements in the response vector, this is an estimate of the same entropy value as $\HH_\text{ind}( R | S )$.
Except the bias on $\HH_\text{sh}( R | S )$ will be similar to the bias of $\HH( R | S )$ because each computation uses the same number of samples.
Consequently, we can estimate the mutual information between $S$ and $R$ using
\begin{align}
\I_{\text{sh}}(S;R)
   &= \HH( R ) - \left( \HH( R | S ) - \left( \HH_\text{sh}( R | S ) - \HH_\text{ind}( R | S ) \right) \right) \notag
\\ &= \HH( R ) - \HH( R | S ) + \HH_\text{sh}( R | S ) - \HH_\text{ind}( R | S )
,\end{align}
which has a much smaller bias than $\I_{\text{uncorrected}}(S;R)$.

An alternative method to correct for the bias is to decompose the measured mutual information as a power series in terms of $\nicefrac{1}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of trials recorded.
The $\nicefrac{1}{N}$ coefficient in the expansion depends only on the number of stimuli and number of possible responses \citep{Miller1955,Treves1995}.
This dominant term is a good estimate of the bias, and subtracting it from our uncorrected information value greatly improves its accuracy \citep{Treves1995}.
This works for a single-dimensional or multi-dimensional response, and is more accurate than shuffling for a single-dimensional response \citep{Panzeri1996}.
However, this term is dependent on the on the total number of potential responses for each stimulus.
Since some stimuli may not be able to elicit every response, this is smaller than the number of theoretically possible responses.
However as described above, some responses may be possible to produce but unobserved in the limited set of samples.
Consequently, \ac{PT} bias-correction method of \citet{Panzeri1996} uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the actual number of potential responses.
This method was observed to be accurate provided there are at least 4 times as many repetitions of each stimulus as there are possible responses \citep{Panzeri2007}.

A second method of correcting the bias which uses a power series expansion is the \ac{QE} method of \citet{Strong1998}.
Here, the bias on the mutual information is assumed to be well approximated by a second order $\nicefrac{1}{N}$ expression,
\begin{equation}
\I_{\text{uncorrected}}(S;R) =
\I_{\text{true}}(S;R) + \frac{a}{N} + \frac{b}{N^2}
,\end{equation}
and the two free parameters, $a$ and $b$, are found by computing the information content with fractions of the full available dataset (\ie{} using $\nicefrac{N}{2}$ and $\nicefrac{N}{4}$ trials).
Since the two are built on the same assumptions, \ac{QE} gives similar performance to \ac{PT}, but with because it is computationally instead of analytically derived it requires more computational processing.

% Consider discussing Best Universal Bound (BUB) method (Paninski, 2003)

The \ac{NSB} entropy estimation method \citep{Nemenman2004} provides an alternative framework through which the bias can minimised.
This method begins with a uniform prior and uses Bayesian inference to update the probability distribution given each sample in turn.
The result has less residual bias than the \ac{PT} or \ac{QE} methods, but at higher computational cost \citep{Panzeri2007}.

Each of these bias correction methods make a trade off between variability and bias.
Introducing more terms in order to reduce the bias invariably increases variability, but this is a price worth paying since the uncorrected bias is so prominent in the results.
Unless indicated otherwise, we will be using the \ac{PT} bias correction method when computing mutual information with a single dimensional response, and $\I_{\text{sh}}$ with \ac{PT} when using multi-dimensional response vector.
In addition to this, we will repeat the mutual information calculation with shuffled stimulus-response pairing multiple times (typically 20 different shuffled pairings) with bias correction and use the average of the bootstraps to estimate the residual bias uncorrected by \ac{PT}.
The estimated residual bias is also removed from our reported mutual information between stimulus and response.

\section{Neural correlations}
\label{sec:bg-corr}

When an individual is repeatedly presented with the same stimulus, a representation of the stimulus is formed within the brain of the individual.
One might expect that, should we eliminate variations in the environment such that an external stimulus is precisely the same --- an identical audio track is played without any background stimulus or a visual image is presented with the eyes held in place, for instance --- the activity within the associated sensory cortex would be identical on each repetition of the stimulus presentation.
However this is not the case.
Firstly, some stimuli, such as optical illusions and multistable perceptual phenomena induce unstable high-level representations in the brain \citep{Lumer1998,Sterzer2009,Watanabe2014}.
This aside, for more classical typical stimuli (with only a single perceptual interpretation) the high-level representations of stimuli are stable, but the activity of each individual neuron is not.
On each successive presentation of a stimulus, the number of spikes elicited in response to the stimulus and the time at each occurs may vary.
Precisely how a stable internal representation is of a stimulus is constructed from the collection of unstable responses from individual neurons remains an open question actively researched within the theoretical neuroscience community.

Since neurons function in harmony and not in isolation, and the neural code is distributed across the population of many neurons, it is often important to consider how the behaviour of multiple neurons relate to one-another.
A simple way to do this is to measure the correlation between the outputs of pairs of neurons.

Although this is a much less nuanced technique than using Shannon information to study the relationship between the neurons, measuring the correlation provides us with a much easier to use metric.
In particular, the amount of data needed to measure the mutual information between stimulus and response increases exponentially in the dimensionality of the response.
This means it is impossible to compute the amount of information conveyed by in the response of more than a handful of neurons.
However, a simplistic interpretation of the correlation can be simplistic because, as we discuss below, one must take into account the relationship between the signal and the noise correlation to correctly understand the impact of the neural correlations on the information contained by a collection of neurons.


\subsection{Signal correlations}
\label{sec:bg-sigcorr}

All other things being held constant, the response to a stimulus from an individual neuron will come from a fixed distribution.
Studying the average firing rate evoked in a single neuron in response to a collection of stimuli allows us to investigate the response profile of the neuron.
When the collection of stimuli vary parametrically, the distribution of responses for a given neuron with respect to this parameter is known as its \termemph{tuning curve}.

We can evaluate how similar the response profiles are for two neurons by computing their signal correlation.
To do so, we first find the average response from each neuron for a set of stimuli, $S$.
% Neural responses to repeated stimuli have high-variance, indicating a large amount of noise in the system.
Next, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two sets of responses.
% By averaging the responses, we are sure to remove the effect of any correlations in the noise on the
In doing so, we treat each unique stimulus in $S$ as an independent sample of the relationship between the two neurons.
Some neurons behave similarly to each other in response to stimulation across a range of potential stimuli, and these pairs of neurons have correlated responses with respect to the input stimuli.

From an information theoretic perspective, neurons with high signal correlation will have high redundancy.
Of course, a redundant neural code is potentially useful as a method of error correction \citep[Chapter~1]{mackay2003information}, providing robustness against neuron death.
Having multiple neurons encoding the same information can improve accuracy by considering the population activity (the total or average of each neuron) instead of the individuals, and this may also permit a faster response time within the brain.
However, the prospective gain in performance when considering the responses from a set of neurons (redundant or not) depends on their noise correlations, and the relationship between the signal and noise correlation for the pair.
% Repetition is an inefficient method of error correction though \citep[Chapter~1]{mackay2003information}, and neuroscientists do not typically interpret groups of neurons to be duplicated instantiations of the same function of the stimulus.


\subsection{Noise correlations}
\label{sec:bg-noisecorr}

Previously we noted that the response from a single neuron to a fixed stimulus is not fixed but effectively sampled from some stochastic distribution.
This internally-generated fluctuation in the neuronal response is referred to as noise.%
When we consider a pair of neurons, the responses from each may vary independently over their two distributions; alternatively their responses may co-vary.
If the simultaneously measured responses from the pair of neurons are both higher than average on the same trials, and lower than average on the same trials, their noise is positively correlated.
Should the simultaneously responses from one neuron be consistently higher than average when the other is lower than average, we say their noise is negatively correlated.

To a certain extent, positive noise correlations between neighbouring neurons in are inevitable, because they have correlated inputs.
Firstly, the path length (in the graphical sense of the number of separating nodes) between any given pair is likely to be short for because neurons are preferentially connected to other neurons within their local vicinity.
Secondly, since there are more neurons in \ac{V1} than in the \ac{LGN} \citep{Kanitscheider2015}, the upscaling of the afferent sensory input makes noise correlations within \ac{V1} inevitable.

Intuitively, one can see that such noise correlations between pairs of neurons can inhibit the accuracy with which the stimulus is encoded in their activities.
Suppose that two neurons both respond monotonically more to stimuli of higher contrast.
Knowing their tuning curves and their current activity, we can decode the contrast of the current stimulus with some level of accuracy.
If the two neurons are independent of one another, knowing the activity of both will give us a more accurate and more precise estimate of the actual contrast of the stimulus.
But if the activity between the pair of neurons is positively correlated, the information conveyed from the pair of neurons is reduced --- when one gives an overestimate of the contrast from a by-chance elevated activity level, so does the other.
In contrast, negative correlations would enhance our decoding accuracy, for an overestimate from one neuron would more frequently be mitigated by an underestimate from the other.

However, this line of thinking only holds for a homogeneous population of neurons, where every neuron has its response drawn from the same distribution.
As illustrated in \autoref{fig:Averbeck2006a}, if a pair of neurons have positive signal correlation, then a positive noise correlation points in the direction distinguishing between the two stimuli, reducing the amount of information encoded by the pair of neurons.
If the pair of neurons have negatively correlated responses with respect to the stimuli, a positive noise correlation increases the amount of information encoded instead (\autoref{fig:Averbeck2006b}).

We show the effect of positive noise correlations on the information encoded by two neurons that respond to two different stimuli in three scenarios.
The panels on the left show the original unshuffled responses, those on the right show the effect of shuffling the responses over trials to destroy the noise correlations.
Each ellipse indicates the \SI{95}{\percent} \acf{CI} for the responses.
Each diagonal line shows the optimal decision boundary --- responses falling above the line are classified as stimulus $2$ and responses below the line are classified as stimulus $1$.
\protect\subref{fig:Averbeck2006a}: A larger fraction of the ellipses lie on the ``wrong'' side of the decision boundary for the true, correlated responses than for the independent responses, so $I-I_\text{shuffled} = \Delta I_\text{shuffled} < 0$.

A similar line of reasoning can be considered for two neurons with offset tuning curves \citet{Franke2016}.
As shown in \autoref{fig:Franke2016}, when the two tuning curves are considered together we traverse a manifold in $2d$ space.
Noise correlations are a hindrance only when the direction of noise correlation points in the same direction as the derivative of the tuning manifold, since this change is easily confused with a change in the parameter describing the manifold.
Whereas noise correlations which are orthogonal to the manifold are beneficial to the neural code, since the result has lower variability when projected onto the manifold than that of independently generated noise.
However, when the manifold forms a closed loop (as is the case with orientation tuning, shown in \autoref{fig:Franke2016}) the derivative of the tuning manifold processes through a full \SI{360}{\degree}, and the ideal noise correlation varies depending upon which stimulus signal is under consideration.

\captionemph{Impact of different structures of noise correlation upon population coding.}
\protect\subref{fig:Franke2016a}: Two model direction-selective neurons respond to different stimuli (dashed lines) according to tuning curves (solid grey curves), $f_1(\theta)$ and $f_2(\theta)$, with two direction preferences that differ by \SI{90}{\degree}.
\protect\subref{fig:Franke2016b}: The two tuning curves are represented as a solid grey line parametrized by the stimulus direction, $\theta$.
In the space of the two-neuron output, this grey line forms an informative subspace: the location of the pair response along the grey line yields information about the stimulus presented.
More precisely, for each stimulus, $\theta$, the tangent vector, $(f'_1(\theta),f'_2(\theta))$, defines the informative direction (arrows in colours corresponding to the stimulus values in the left panel).
\protect\subref{fig:Franke2016c}: For each stimulus presented, noise correlation distorts the cloud of two-neuron responses about the mean over trials; depending upon the geometry of this distortion with respect to the informative direction, it can either benefit or harm the coding accuracy.
Positive correlation in the pair ($c>0$) favours the reliability of coding with respect to the independent case ($c=0$), while negative correlation ($c<0$) is detrimental.
Specifically, when $c>0$, the responses for nearby stimulus directions overlap less, and, hence, coding is more reliable.
(Conversely, if the two tuning curves have similar preference, $c<0$ is favourable whereas $c>0$ is detrimental.)
More precisely, coding is favoured if the eigenvector of the covariance matrix parallel to the tangent vector, $(f'_1(\theta),f'_2(\theta))$, comes with a small eigenvalue; correlation then relegates the noise in the orthogonal, uninformative direction.
