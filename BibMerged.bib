abstract = {Hubel {\&} Wiesel classified primary visual cortex (V1) neurons as either simple, with responses modulated by the spatial phase of a sine grating, or complex, i.e. largely phase invariant. Much progress has been made in understanding how simple cells develop, and there are now detailed computational models establishing how they can form topographic maps ordered by orientation preference. There are also models of how complex cells can develop using outputs from simple cells with different phase preferences, but no model of how a topographic orientation map of complex cells could be formed based on the actual connectivity patterns found in V1. Addressing this question is important, because the majority of existing developmental models of simple-cell maps group neurons selective to similar spatial phases together, which is contrary to experimental evidence, and makes it difficult to construct complex cells. Overcoming this limitation is not trivial, because mechanisms responsible for map development drive receptive fields of nearby neurons to be highly correlated, while co-oriented receptive fields of opposite phases are anti-correlated. In this work, we model V1 as two topographically organised sheets representing cortical layer 4 and 2/3. Only layer 4 receives direct thalamic input. Both sheets are connected with narrow feed-forward and feedback connectivity. Only layer 2/3 contains strong long-range lateral connectivity, in line with current anatomical findings. Initially all weights in the model are random, and each is modified via a Hebbian learning rule. The model develops smooth, matching, orientation preference maps in both sheets. Layer 4 units become simple cells, with phase preference arranged randomly, while those in layer 2/3 are primarily complex cells. To our knowledge this model is the first explaining how simple cells can develop with random phase preference, and how maps of complex cells can develop, using only realistic patterns of connectivity.},

@article{Barlow2008,
abstract = {Plant neurobiology, a new and developing area in the plant sciences, is a meeting place for scientists concerned with exploring how plants perceive signs within their environment and convert them into internal electro-chemical ('plant neurobiological') signals. These signals, in turn, permit rapid modifications of physiology and development that help plants adjust to changes in their environment. The use of the epithet 'neurobiology' in the context of plant life has, however, led to misunderstanding about the aims, content, and scope of this topic. This difficulty is possibly due to the terminology used, since this is often unfamiliar in the context of plants. In the present article, the scope of plant neurobiology is explored and some of analogical and metaphorical aspects of the subject are discussed. One approach to reconciling possible problems of using the term 'plant neurobiology' and, at the same time, of analysing information transfer in plants and the developmental processes which are regulated thereby, is through Living Systems Theory (LST). This theory specifically directs attention to the means by which information is gathered and processed, and then dispersed throughout the hierarchy of organisational levels of the plant body. Attempts to identify the plant 'neural' structures point to the involvement of the vascular tissue - xylem and phloem - in conveying electrical impulses generated in zones of special sensitivity to receptive locations throughout the plant in response to mild stress. Vascular tissue therefore corresponds, at the level of organismic organisation, with the informational 'channel and net' subsystem of LST. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bednar2012,
abstract = {Researchers have used a very wide range of different experimental and theoretical approaches to help understand mammalian visual systems. These approaches tend to have quite different assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses. Computational models of the visual cortex, in particular, have typically implemented either a proposed circuit for part of the visual cortex of the adult, assuming a very specific wiring pattern based on findings from adults, or else attempted to explain the long-term development of a visual cortex region from an initially undifferentiated starting point. Previous models of adult {\{}V1{\}} have been able to account for many of the measured properties of {\{}V1{\}} neurons, while not explaining how these properties arise or why neurons have those properties in particular. Previous developmental models have been able to reproduce the overall organization of specific feature maps in V1, such as orientation maps, but are generally formulated at an abstract level that does not allow testing with real images or analysis of detailed neural properties relevant for visual function. In this review of results from a large set of new, integrative models developed from shared principles and a set of shared software components, I show how these models now represent a single, consistent explanation for a wide body of experimental evidence, and form a compact hypothesis for much of the development and behavior of neurons in the visual cortex. The models are the first developmental models with wiring consistent with V1, the first to have realistic behavior with respect to visual contrast, and the first to include all of the demonstrated visual feature dimensions. The goal is to have a comprehensive explanation for why {\{}V1{\}} is wired as it is in the adult, and how that circuitry leads to the observed behavior of the neurons during visual tasks.},

Such photic entrainment requires neither rods nor cones, the only known retinal photoreceptors. Here, we show that retinal ganglion cells innervating the SCN are intrinsically photosensitive. Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.},

abstract = {Many thousands of cortical neurons are activated by any single sensory stimulus, but the organization of these populations is poorly understood. For example, are neurons in mouse visual cortex--whose preferred orientations are arranged randomly--organized with respect to other response properties? Using high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we characterized the receptive fields of up to 100 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a 200 $\mu$m imaged plane. Inhibitory neurons had nonlinearly summating, complex-like receptive fields and were weakly tuned for orientation. Excitatory neurons had linear, simple receptive fields that can be studied with noise stimuli and system identification methods. We developed a wavelet stimulus that evoked rich population responses and yielded the detailed spatial receptive fields of most excitatory neurons in a plane. Receptive fields and visual responses were locally highly diverse, with nearby neurons having largely dissimilar receptive fields and response time courses. Receptive-field diversity was consistent with a nearly random sampling of orientation, spatial phase, and retinotopic position. Retinotopic positions varied locally on average by approximately half the receptive-field size. Nonetheless, the retinotopic progression across the cortex could be demonstrated at the scale of 100 $\mu$m, with a magnification of ≈ 10 $\mu$m/°. Receptive-field and response similarity were in register, decreasing by 50{\%} over a distance of 200 $\mu$m. Together, the results indicate considerable randomness in local populations of mouse visual cortical neurons, with retinotopy as the principal source of organization at the scale of hundreds of micrometers.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to both luminance and color and are integral to the transformation of color representation from retinal cone axes to perceptual hues. To isolate the coding and circuitry underlying this transformation, we employed the silent substitution method to minimize luminance-related responses. The silent substitution method depends on the choice of luminosity function, typically defined as sensitivity to a ratio of L and M cone subtypes. As the field has not agreed upon a unique luminosity function to study color representation in macaque V1, we began by testing whether the choice of luminosity function, human (1.5L + M) or macaque (1L + 1M, Dobkins et al. 2000), affects the quality of isolation of the color circuitry.We used intrinsic signal optical imaging to identify blob and interblob structures and measured single-unit responses via targeted multi-electrode arrays in anaesthetized macaque V1. Stimuli consisted of 4 Hz chromatically-modulated drifting gratings presented monocularly.Our initial results indicate that a heterogeny of luminosity functions are represented by V1 neurons, with a tendency for neurons with similar luminosity functions to cluster together in cortex. This finding is consistent with reports of local clustering of L and M cone subtypes in the human and macaque retina, suggesting that this spatial non-uniformity of spectral sensitivity persists in the color representation through to V1.},

We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.},

abstract = {Traditional color vision theory posits that three types of retinal photopigments transduce light into a trivariate neural color code, thereby explaining color-matching behaviors. Thisprinciple of trichromacy is in need of reexamination in view of molecular genetics results suggesting that a substantial percentage of women possess more than three classes of retinal photopigments. At issue is the question of whether four-photopigment retinas necessarily yield trichromatic color perception. In the present paper, we review results and theory underlying the accepted photoreceptor-based model of trichromacy. A review of the psychological literature shows that gender-linked differences in color perception warrant further investigation of retinal photopigment classes and color perception relations. We use genetic analyses to examine an important position in the gene sequence, and we empirically assess and compare the color perception of individuals possessing more than three retinal photopigment genes with those possessing fewer retinal photopigment genes. Women with four-photopigment genotypes are found to perceive significantly more chromatic appearances in comparison with either male or female trichromat controls. We provide a rationale for this previously undetected finding and discuss implications for theories of color perception and gender differences in color behavior.},

abstract = {We have examined the colour vision of 43 female subjects in the age range 30–59 yr of whom 31 were obligate carriers of various forms of colour deficiency and the rest were women who had no known colour-deficient relatives. In the case of all the carriers we established the phenotypes of their colour-deficient sons. As a group, carriers made significantly more errors on the Ishihara plates and showed enlarged matching ranges on the Nagel anomaloscope, but we could not replicate earlier reports of increased error scores on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test or of systematic shifts in Rayleigh match mid-points. We did find that the colour matches of carriers of deuteranomaly were significantly displaced from those of normals in a ratio-matching task in which a mixture of 546 and 600 nm was matched with a mixture of 570 and 690 nm. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, women who are heterozygous for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae and we ask whether this affords them an extra dimension of colour vision, by analogy to New World monkeys where heterozygous females gain trichromacy in a basically dichromatic species. Many carriers of anomalous trichromacy exhibited no evidence for tetrachromacy, in that they accepted large-field Rayleigh matches following a rod bleach and they were unable to set unique matches in our ratio-matching task. However, eight carriers of anomalous trichromacy—and no other subject—refused large-field Rayleigh matches; and we found one carrier of deuteranomaly who was apparently able to make unique matches in the ratio-matching task.},

abstract = {When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, perception alternates spontaneously between each monocular view, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Functional brain imaging in humans was used to study the neural basis of these subjective perceptual changes. Cortical regions whose activity reflected perceptual transitions included extrastriate areas of the ventral visual pathway, and parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in spatial attention; whereas the extrastriate areas were also engaged by nonrivalrous perceptual changes, activity in the frontoparietal cortex was specifically associated with perceptual alternation only during rivalry. These results suggest that frontoparietal areas play a central role in conscious perception, biasing the content of visual awareness toward abstract internal representations of visual scenes, rather than simply toward space.},

abstract = {In Experiments 1 and 2, monkeys received 3-stage operations intended to serially disconnect parieto-preoccipital from striate cortex. At each stage (unilateral parieto-preoccipital removal, contralateral striate removal and posterior callosal transection) the monkeys were tested for retention of the landmark task, a visuospatial discrimination sensitive to the effects of bilateral parieto-preoccipital damage. To check the effectiveness of the disconnection, the monkeys were also tested after removal of the remaining parieto-preoccipital cortex. The results demonstrated that corticocortical inputs from striate cortex are crucial for the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex, just as they had been shown earlier to be crucial for the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex. Relative to inferior temporal cortex, however, parieto-preoccipital cortex was found to be especially dependent on ipsilateral (as compared with contralateral) striate inputs. In Experiment 3, monkeys received bilateral lesions of either lateral or medial striate cortex and were tested on both a pattern discrimination task, to assess residual inferior temporal function, and the landmark task, to assess residual parieto-preoccipital function. The results indicated that the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex are especially dependent on inputs from lateral striate cortex, whereas the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex are equally dependent on inputs from lateral and medial striate cortex. The relatively greater contribution to parieto-preoccipital than to inferior temporal cortex made by ipsilateral and medial striate inputs (representing contralateral and peripheral visual fields, respectively) can also be seen in the receptive field properties of parieto-preoccipital and inferior temporal neurons. The differences in the organization of striate inputs to these two cortical association areas presumably reflect differences in the processing required for spatial vs object vision.},

@article{Shepherd2012,
abstract = {If biology throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was dominated by the metaphor of the machine, the metaphor underlying twenty first century biology is that of the network or web. A rapid proliferation of molecular data coupled with increased computational power has revealed that gene regulation, protein interaction, the topology of metabolism and signal-transduction in and between cells, tissues, organs and organisms can all be described as robust, resilient and modular networks. Such small-world networks are characterised by rapid signal propagation, a capacity for computation and for synchronisation between the same, or different, hierarchic levels. Organelles, cells, tissues, organisms and ecosystems are not mere aggregations of components, but are hierarchies of interacting systems or modules, each possessing a degree of autonomy, and each a degree of interdependence. Into this metaphor of the network has emerged the discipline of integrative plant electrophysiology, called by its adherents, plant neurobiology. This field aims to understand how plants perceive, recall and process experience, coordinating behavioural responses via integrated information networks that include molecular, chemical and electrical levels of signalling. Integrative plant electrophysiology rejects the long standing view of plants as passive insensate automata that react to the environment with mechanical simplicity. The controversial use of the word ‘neurobiology' as applied to plants signifies that long-distance electrical signals, such as action potentials, convey meaningful information from the site of initiation to a distant site, where the signal is interpreted and evaluated, and an adaptive behavioural response is mounted. Such inter-module communication is ‘nervous' in the sense that it is adaptive, thereby implying capacities for memory, learning, anticipating the future and for generating novel responses. By itself a touch stimulus is meaningless, and by itself a behaviour (e.g. Mimosa leaf folding) is meaningless. Meaning lies in the network of processes that associate and integrate these events. Communication processes within, and between plants and associated organisms, can therefore be considered as biosemiotic, involving as they do the interpretation and evaluation of stimuli. This review traces historical aspects of the development of integrative plant electrophysiology and the methods that inform it, with a special emphasis on the work of Indian biophysicist Sir J. C. Bose (1858–1937), who, in an impressive body of published research, proposed that plants and animals share essentially similar fundamental physiological mechanisms. The first scientist to appreciate that responses in plants (e.g. leaf folding in the sensitive plant Mimosa ) constitute behaviour reliant on integrative electrical signals; Bose argued further that all plants co-ordinate their movements and integrate their responses to the world through electrical signalling. Despite their sessile habits, plants are to be regarded as sensate, active, intelligent explorers of the world. Bose identified a fundamental physiological motif that interlinked measurable pulsations or oscillations in cellular electric potentials with oscillations in cell turgor pressure, cellular contractility and growth. All plants respond to the world and to other living things through adaptations of this pulsatile motif, an electromechanical pulse that underlies electro-osmotically enacted behaviour. J.C. Bose's conclusions that all plants possess a nervous system, a form of intelligence, and a capacity for remembering and learning, were poorly received by prominent electrophysiologists of his time. Experiments devoted to plant responsiveness, inter-organism communication, kin-recognition, foraging, intelligence and learning as mediated by electrical signalling, are now published and debated in the mainstream literature as aspects of integrative plant electrophysiology.},

Here, we review recent work on the neural mechanisms underlying multistable perception and how such work has contributed to understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. Particular emphasis is put on the role of high-level brain mechanisms that are involved in actively selecting and interpreting sensory information, and their interactions with lower-level processes that are more directly concerned with the processing of sensory stimulus properties.},

abstract = {Development of orientation maps in ferret and cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to be stable, in that the earliest measurable maps are similar in form to the eventual adult map, robust, in that similar maps develop in both dark rearing and in a variety of normal visual environments, and yet adaptive, in that the final map pattern reflects the statistics of the specific visual environment. How can these three properties be reconciled? Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results. Specifically, contrast-gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

We show that closely neighboring TC neurons generate widely differing patterns of monosynaptic activation within layers 4 and 6 of their aligned column. Moreover, synaptic currents generated by TC impulses with long preceding interspike intervals are greatly enhanced in both of these layers. The degree of this enhancement differs reliably among neighboring TC neurons but, for a given neuron, is very similar in layers 4 and 6. Our results indicate that in the awake state, TC synapses throughout the depth of the cortex serve as powerful filters of sensory information that reflect individual characteristics of their parent TC neuron.},

abstract = {Among the crowning achievements of Hubel and Wiesel's highly influential studies on primary visual cortex is the description of the cortical hypercolumn, a set of cortical columns with functional properties spanning a particular parameter space. This fundamental concept laid the groundwork for the notion of a modular sensory cortex, canonical cortical circuits and an understanding of visual field coverage beyond simple retinotopy. Surprisingly, the search for and description of analogous hypercolumnar organizations in other cortical areas to date has been limited. In the present work, we have applied the hypercolumn concept to the functional organization of the second visual area, V2. We found it important to separate out the original definition of the hypercolumn from other associated observations and concepts, not all of which are applicable to V2. We present results indicating that, as in V1, the V2 hypercolumns for orientation and binocular interaction (disparity) run roughly orthogonal to each other. We quantified the 'nearest neighbour' periodicities for the hypercolumns for ocular dominance, orientation, colour and disparity, and found a marked similarity in the periodicities of all of these hypercolumns, both across hypercolumn type and across visual areas V1 and V2. The results support an underlying common mechanism that constrains the anatomical extent of hypercolumn systems, and highlight the original definition of the cortical hypercolumn.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The mammalian neocortex undergoes dramatic transformation during development, from a seemingly homogenous sheet of neuroep- ithelial cells into a complex structure that is tangentially divided into discrete areas. This process is thought to be controlled by a combination of intrinsic patterning mechanisms within the cortex and afferent axonal projections from the thalamus. However, roles of thalamicafferents in theformationof areas are still poorlyunderstood.Inthis study,weshowthat genetically increasingordecreasing the size of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the mouse thalamus resulted in a corresponding change in the size of the primary visual area. Furthermore, elimination of most thalamocortical projections from the outset of their development resulted in altered areal gene expression patterns, particularly in the primary visual and somatosensory areas, where they lost sharp boundaries with adjacent areas. Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of thalamic afferents in the establishment of neocortical areas.},

abstract = {What, if anything, is the functional significance of spatial patterning in cortical feature maps? We ask this question of four major theories of cortical map formation: self-organizing maps, wiring optimization, place coding, and reaction-diffusion. We argue that (i) self-organizing maps yield spatial patterning only as a by-product of efficient mechanisms for developing environmentally appropriate distributions of feature preferences, (ii) wiring optimization assumes rather than explains a map-like organization, (iii) place-coding mechanisms can at best explain only a subset of maps in functional terms, and (iv) reaction-diffusion models suggest two factors in the evolution of maps, the first based on efficient development of feature distributions, and the second based on generating feature-specific long-range recurrent cortical circuitry. None of these explanations for the existence of topological maps requires spatial patterning in maps to be useful. Thus despite these useful frameworks for understanding how maps form and how they are wired, the possibility that patterns are merely epiphenomena in the evolution of mammalian neocortex cannot be rejected. The article is intended as a nontechnical introduction to the assumptions and predictions of these four important classes of models, along with other possible functional explanations for maps. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {A rare type of mammalian retinal ganglion cell (RGC) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is a photoreceptor. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) drive circadian-clock resetting, pupillary constriction, and other non-image-forming photic responses. Both the light responses of ipRGCs and the behaviors they drive are remarkably sustained, raising the possibility that, unlike rods and cones, ipRGCs do not adjust their sensitivity according to lighting conditions (?adaptation?). We found, to the contrary, that ipRGC sensitivity is plastic, strongly influenced by lighting history. When exposed to a constant, bright background, the background-evoked response decayed, and responses to superimposed flashes grew in amplitude, indicating light adaptation. After extinction of a light-adapting background, sensitivity recovered progressively in darkness, indicating dark adaptation. Because these adjustments in sensitivity persisted when synapses were blocked, they constitute ?photoreceptor adaptation? rather than ?network adaptation.? Implications for the mechanisms generating various non-image-forming visual responses are discussed.},

We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to experiments on the motion-sensitive neuron H1 of the fly's visual system, where we confirm that two spikes close together in time carry far more than twice the information carried by a single spike. We analyze the sources of this synergy and provide evidence that pairs of spikes close together in time may be especially important patterns in the code of H1.},

abstract = {Decoding the activity of a population of neurons is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A key aspect of this problem is determining whether correlations in the activity, i.e., noise correlations, are important. If they are important, then the decoding problem is high dimensional: decoding algorithms must take the correlational structure in the activity into account. If they are not important, or if they play a minor role, then the decoding problem can be reduced to lower dimension and thus made more tractable. The issue of whether correlations are important has been a subject of heated debate. The debate centers around the validity of the measures used to address it. Here, we evaluate three of the most commonly used ones: synergy, $\Delta$Ishuffled, and $\Delta$I. We show that synergy and $\Delta$Ishuffled are confounded measures: they can be zero when correlations are clearly important for decoding and positive when they are not. In contrast, $\Delta$I is not confounded. It is zero only when correlations are not important for decoding and positive only when they are; that is, it is zero only when one can decode exactly as well using a decoder that ignores correlations as one can using a decoder that does not, and it is positive only when one cannot decode as well. Finally, we show that $\Delta$I has an information theoretic interpretation; it is an upper bound on the information lost when correlations are ignored.},

abstract = {The estimation of the information carried by spike times is crucial for a quantitative understanding of brain function, but it is difficult because of an upward bias due to limited experimental sampling. We present new progress, based on two basic insights, on reducing the bias problem. First, we show that by means of a careful application of data-shuffling techniques, it is possible to cancel almost entirely the bias of the noise entropy, the most biased part of information. This procedure provides a new information estimator that is much less biased than the standard direct one and has similar variance. Second, we use a nonparametric test to determine whether all the information encoded by the spike train can be decoded assuming a low-dimensional response model. If this is the case, the complexity of response space can be fully captured by a small number of easily sampled parameters. Combining these two different procedures, we obtain a new class of precise estimators of information quantities, which can provide data-robust upper and lower bounds to the mutual information. These bounds are tight even when the number of trials per stimulus available is one order of magnitude smaller than the number of possible responses. The effectiveness and the usefulness of the methods are tested through applications to simulated data and recordings from somatosensory cortex. This application shows that even in the presence of strong correlations, our methods constrain precisely the amount of information encoded by real spike trains recorded in vivo.},

abstract = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called "bias"). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

This new method considers, in an exact way, the effects of high order spike train statistics, with no approximation involved, and it generalizes our previous work that was valid for short time windows and small populations. The new technique permits one to quantify the information transmitted if each cell were to convey fully independent information separately from the information available in the presence of synergy-redundancy effects. Synergy-redundancy effects are shown to arise from three possible contributions: a redundant contribution due to similarities in the mean response profiles of different cells; a synergistic stimulus-dependent correlational contribution quantifying the information content of changes of correlations with stimulus, and a stimulus-independent correlational contribution term that reflects interactions between the distribution of rates of individual cells and the average level of cross-correlation. We apply the new method to simultaneously recorded data from somatosensory and visual cortices. We demonstrate that it constitutes a reliable tool to determine the role of cross-correlated activity in stimulus coding even when high firing rate data (such as multi-unit recordings) are considered.},

Microdialysis was performed with a Ringer containing low concentrations (0.01 microM) of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine. Quinpirole (10 microg/kg s.c.) decreased striatal dopamine and acetylcholine release. Administration of PD 128,907 (50 microg/kg) decreased dopamine but failed to affect acetylcholine release. SCH 39166 (50 microg/kg s.c.) stimulated dopamine release and reduced acetylcholine release. Pretreatment with quinpirole reduced (5 microg/kg s.c.) or completely prevented (10 microg/kg s.c.) the stimulation of dopamine release elicited by SCH 39166 (50 microg/kg s.c.); on the other hand, pretreatment with quinpirole (5 and 10 microg/kg) potentiated the reduction of striatal acetylcholine release induced by SCH 39166 (50 microg/kg s.c.). Similarly, pretreatment with PD 128,907 (50 microg/kg) which prevented the increase of dopamine release induced by SCH 39166 (50 microg/kg), potentiated the reduction of striatal acetylcholine transmission elicited by SCH 39166. Thus, pretreatment with low doses of quinpirole or PD 128,907 influences in opposite manner the effect of SCH 39166 on striatal dopamine and acetylcholine release, counteracting the increase of dopamine release and potentiating the decrease in acetylcholine release. These results provide further evidence for the existence of a tonic stimulatory input of endogenous dopamine on striatal acetylcholine transmission mediated by dopamine D(1) receptors.},

However, the ability to detect small changes in the contrast of simple visual stimuli could not be improved by repetition. Here we show that the performance of this basic task could be modified after the discrimination of the stimulus contrast was practised in the presence of similar laterally placed stimuli, suggesting a change in the local neuronal circuit involved in the task. On the basis of a combination of hebbian and anti-hebbian synaptic learning rules compatible with our results, we propose a mechanism of plasticity in the visual cortex that is enabled by a change in the context.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning can be defined as practice-induced improvement in the ability to perform specific perceptual tasks. We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons display two fundamental nonlinear response characteristics: contrast-set gain control (also termed contrast normalization) and response expansion (also termed half-squaring). These nonlinearities could play an important role in forming and maintaining stimulus selectivity during natural viewing, but only if they operate well within the time frame of a single fixation. To analyze the temporal dynamics of these nonlinearities, we measured the responses of individual neurons, recorded from the primary visual cortex of monkeys and cats, as a function of the contrast of transient stationary gratings that were presented for a brief interval (200 ms). We then examined 1) the temporal response profile (i.e., the post stimulus time histogram) as a function of contrast and 2) the contrast response function throughout the course of the temporal response. We found that the shape and complexity of the temporal response profile varies considerably from cell to cell. However, within a given cell, the shape remains relatively invariant as a function of contrast and appears to be simply scaled and shifted. Stated quantitatively, approximately 95{\%} of the variation in the temporal responses as a function of contrast could be accounted for by scaling and shifting the average poststimulus time histogram. Equivalently, we found that the overall shape of the contrast response function (measured every 2 ms) remains relatively invariant from the onset through the entire temporal response. Further, the contrast-set gain control and the response expansion are fully expressed within the first 10 ms after the onset of the response. Stated quantitatively, the same, scaled Naka-Rushton equation (with the same half-saturation contrast and expansive response exponent) provides a good fit to the contrast response function from the first 10 ms through the last 10 ms of the temporal response. Based upon these measurements, it appears as though the two nonlinear properties, contrast-set gain control and response expansion, are present in full strength, virtually instantaneously, at the onset of the response. This observation suggests that response expansion and contrast-set gain control can influence the performance of visual cortex neurons very early in a single fixation, based on the contrast within that fixation. In the discussion, we consider the implications of the results within the context of 1) slower types of contrast gain control, 2) discrimination performance, 3) drifting steady-state measurements, 4) functional models that incorporate response expansion and contrast normalization, and5) structural models of the biochemical and biophysical neural mechanisms.},

abstract = {Rats achieve remarkable texture discriminations by sweeping their facial whiskers along surfaces. This work explores how neurons at two levels of the sensory pathway, trigeminal ganglion and barrel cortex, carry information about such stimuli. We identified two biologically plausible coding mechanisms, spike counts and patterns, and used "mutual information" to quantify how reliably neurons in anesthetized rats reported texture when "decoded" according to these candidate mechanisms. For discriminations between surfaces of different coarseness, spike counts could be decoded reliably and rapidly (within 30 ms after stimulus onset in cortex). Information increased as responses were considered as spike patterns with progressively finer temporal precision. At highest temporal resolution (spike sequences across six bins of 4 ms), the quantity of "information" in patterns rose 150{\%} for ganglion neurons and 110{\%} for cortical neurons above that in spike counts. In some cases, patterns permitted discriminations not supported by spike counts alone.},

abstract = {Systemic administration of amphetamine results in increases in the release of acetylcholine in the cortex. Basal forebrain mediation of this effect was examined in three experiments using microdialysis in freely-moving rats. Experiment 1 examined whether dopamine receptor activity within the basal forebrain was necessary for amphetamine-induced increase in cortical acetylcholine by examining whether intra-basalis perfusion of dopamine antagonists attenuates this increase. Systemic administration of 2.0 mg/kg amphetamine increased dopamine efflux within the basal forebrain nearly 700{\%} above basal levels. However, the increase in cortical acetylcholine efflux following amphetamine administration was unaffected by intra-basalis perfusions of high concentrations of D1- (100 microM SCH 23390) or D2-like (100 microM sulpiride) dopamine receptor antagonists. Experiments 2 and 3 determined whether glutamatergic or GABAergic local modulation of the excitability of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons influences the ability of systemic amphetamine to increase cortical acetylcholine efflux. In Experiment 2, perfusion of kynurenate (1.0 mM), a non-selective glutamate receptor antagonist, into the basal forebrain attenuated the increase in cortical acetylcholine produced by amphetamine. Experiment 3 revealed that positive modulation of GABAergic transmission by bilateral intra-basalis infusion of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (40 microg/hemisphere) also attenuated the amphetamine-stimulated increase in cortical acetylcholine efflux. These data suggest that amphetamine increases cortical acetylcholine release via a complex neuronal network rather than simply increasing basal forebrain D1 or D2 receptor activity.},

abstract = {The present experiments tested the hypothesis that the amphetamine-induced increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens represents a necessary and sufficient component of the ability of systemically administered amphetamine to stimulate cortical acetylcholine release. The effects of systemic or intra-accumbens administration of amphetamine on accumbens dopamine release and cortical acetylcholine release were assessed simultaneously in awake animals equipped with dialysis probes inserted into the shell of the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the ability of intra-accumbens administration of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor antagonists to attenuate the effects of systemic amphetamine on cortical acetylcholine was tested. The effects of all treatments were assessed in interaction with a stimulus-induced activation of cortical acetylcholine release to account for the possibility that the demonstration of the trans-synaptic effects of accumbens dopamine requires pre-activation of basal forebrain circuits. Systemic amphetamine resulted in increases in basal cortical acetylcholine and accumbens dopamine efflux. Intra-accumbens administration of amphetamine substantially increased accumbens dopamine efflux, but did not significantly affect cortical acetylcholine efflux. Furthermore, intra-accumbens administration of sulpiride or SCH 23390 did not attenuate the systemic amphetamine-induced increase in cortical acetylcholine efflux. Collectively, the present data suggest that increases in accumbens dopamine release are neither sufficient nor necessary for the effects of systemically administered amphetamine on cortical acetylcholine release. The systemic amphetamine-induced increase in cortical acetylcholine may be mediated via multiple, parallel pathways and may not be attributable to a single afferent pathway of the basal forebrain.},

During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

In previous studies, this possibility has been examined from the encoding and decoding perspectives. Here we used d prime and related information measures to examine how studies of noise correlations from these two perspectives are related. We found that for a pair of neurons, the effect of noise correlations on information decoding can be zero when the effect of noise correlations on the information encoded obtains its largest positive or negative values. Furthermore, there can be no effect of noise correlations on the information encoded when it has an effect on information decoding. We also measured the effect of noise correlations on information encoding and decoding in simultaneously recorded neurons in the supplementary motor area to see how well d prime accounted for the information actually present in the neural responses and to see how noise correlations affected encoding and decoding in real data. These analyses showed that d prime provides an accurate measure of information encoding and decoding in our population of neurons. We also found that the effect of noise correlations on information encoding was somewhat larger than the effect of noise correlations on information decoding, but both were relatively small. Finally, as predicted theoretically, the effects of correlations were slightly greater for larger ensembles (3-8 neurons) than for pairs of neurons.},

abstract = {Non-human-primate fMRI is becoming increasingly recognised as the missing link between the widely applied methods of human imaging and intracortical animal electrophysiology. A crucial requirement for the optimal application of this method is the precise knowledge of the time course of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. We mapped the BOLD signal time course in the inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB) and in tonotopically defined fields in the auditory cortex of two macaques. The results show little differences in the BOLD-signal time courses within the auditory pathway. However, we observed systematic differences in the magnitude of the change in the BOLD signal with significantly stronger signal changes in field A1 of the auditory cortex compared to field R. The measured time course of the signal was in good agreement with similar studies in human auditory cortex but showed considerable differences to data reported from macaque visual cortex. Consistent with the studies in humans we measured a peak in the BOLD response around 4 s after the onset of 2-s broadband noise stimuli while previous studies recorded from the primary visual cortex of the same species reported the earliest peaks to short visual stimuli several seconds later. The comparison of our results with previous studies does not support differences in haemodynamic responses within the auditory system between human and non-human primates. Furthermore, the data will aid optimal design of future auditory fMRI studies in non-human primates.},

abstract = {The midbrain dopamine neurons are hypothesized to provide a physiological correlate of the reward prediction error signal required by current models of reinforcement learning. We examined the activity of single dopamine neurons during a task in which subjects learned by trial and error when to make an eye movement for a juice reward. We found that these neurons encoded the difference between the current reward and a weighted average of previous rewards, a reward prediction error, but only for outcomes that were better than expected. Thus, the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons is quantitatively predicted by theoretical descriptions of the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models for circumstances in which this signal has a positive value. We also found that the dopamine system continued to compute the reward prediction error even when the behavioral policy of the animal was only weakly influenced by this computation.},

abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

abstract = {Extensive training on simple tasks like fine orientation discrimination results in large improvements in performance, a form of learning known as perceptual learning. Previous neural models have argued that perceptual learning is the result of sharpening and amplification of tuning curves in early visual areas. However, these models are at odds with the conclusions of psychophysical experiments manipulating external noise, which argue for improved decision making, presumably in later visual areas. Here, we explore the possibility that perceptual learning for fine orientation discrimination is due to improved probabilistic inference in early visual areas. We show that this mechanism captures both the changes in response properties observed in early visual areas and the changes in performance observed in psychophysical experiments. We also suggest that sharpening and amplification of tuning curves may play only a minor role in improving performance, in comparison to the role played by the reshaping of inter-neuronal correlations.},

abstract = {Studies analyzing sensory cortical processing or trying to decode brain activity often rely on a combination of different electrophysiological signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. Understanding the relation between these signals and sensory stimuli and between different components of these signals is hence of great interest. We here provide an analysis of LFPs and spiking activity recorded from visual and auditory cortex during stimulation with natural stimuli. In particular, we focus on the time scales on which different components of these signals are informative about the stimulus, and on the dependencies between different components of these signals. Addressing the first question, we find that stimulus information in low frequency bands ({\textless}12 Hz) is high, regardless of whether their energy is computed at the scale of milliseconds or seconds. Stimulus information in higher bands ({\textgreater}50 Hz), in contrast, is scale dependent, and is larger when the energy is averaged over several hundreds of milliseconds. Indeed, combined analysis of signal reliability and information revealed that the energy of slow LFP fluctuations is well related to the stimulus even when considering individual or few cycles, while the energy of fast LFP oscillations carries information only when averaged over many cycles. Addressing the second question, we find that stimulus information in different LFP bands, and in different LFP bands and spiking activity, is largely independent regardless of time scale or sensory system. Taken together, these findings suggest that different LFP bands represent dynamic natural stimuli on distinct time scales and together provide a potentially rich source of information for sensory processing or decoding brain activity.},

The spatial and temporal characteristics of the visual information transmitted across the corpus callosum have been studied in normal cats by recording directly from the corpus callosum and in split-chiasm cats by means of visual evoked potentials (v.e.p.s) and single-unit recordings at the 17/18 border. 2. The modulation transfer functions (m.t.f.s) obtained by recording from the corpus callosum are comparable to the m.t.f.s evaluated by various techniques for the whole visual system of the cat. The spatial and temporal acuities, however, do not reach the values obtained behaviourally or estimated with cortical evoked potentials. 3. In split-chiasm cats, both v.e.p.s and single-unit recordings indicate that the contrast gain of the callosal pathway is considerably lower than the gain of the direct, geniculo-cortical system. Spatial and temporal acuities are lower for the callosal than for the direct system. 4. The same differences in contrast gain between the spatial m.t.f. obtained for the callosal and the direct system have been found in alert split-chiasm cats. 5.

abstract = {Cortical circuits perform the computations underlying rapid perceptual decisions within a few dozen milliseconds with each neuron emitting only a few spikes. Under these conditions, the theoretical analysis of neural population codes is challenging, as the most commonly used theoretical tool--Fisher information--can lead to erroneous conclusions about the optimality of different coding schemes. Here we revisit the effect of tuning function width and correlation structure on neural population codes based on ideal observer analysis in both a discrimination and a reconstruction task. We show that the optimal tuning function width and the optimal correlation structure in both paradigms strongly depend on the available decoding time in a very similar way. In contrast, population codes optimized for Fisher information do not depend on decoding time and are severely suboptimal when only few spikes are available. In addition, we use the neurometric functions of the ideal observer in the classification task to investigate the differential coding properties of these Fisher-optimal codes for fine and coarse discrimination. We find that the discrimination error for these codes does not decrease to zero with increasing population size, even in simple coarse discrimination tasks. Our results suggest that quite different population codes may be optimal for rapid decoding in cortical computations than those inferred from the optimization of Fisher information.},

abstract = {Assessing the reliability of neuronal spike trains is fundamental to an understanding of the neural code. We measured the reproducibility of retinal responses to repeated visual stimuli. In both tiger salamander and rabbit, the retinal ganglion cells responded to random flicker with discrete, brief periods of firing. For any given cell, these firing events covered only a small fraction of the total stimulus time, often less than 5{\%}. Firing events were very reproducible from trial to trial: the timing jitter of individual spikes was as low as 1 msec, and the standard deviation in spike count was often less than 0.5 spikes. Comparing the precision of spike timing to that of the spike count showed that the timing of a firing event conveyed several times more visual information than its spike count. This sparseness and precision were general characteristics of ganglion cell responses, maintained over the broad ensemble of stimulus waveforms produced by random flicker, and over a range of contrasts. Thus, the responses of retinal ganglion cells are not properly described by a firing probability that varies continuously with the stimulus. Instead, these neurons elicit discrete firing events that may be the fundamental coding symbols in retinal spike trains.},

abstract = {The precise timing of spikes of cortical neurons relative to stimulus onset carries substantial sensory information. To access this information the sensory systems would need to maintain an internal temporal reference that reflects the precise stimulus timing. Whether and how sensory systems implement such reference frames to decode time-dependent responses, however, remains debated. Studying the encoding of naturalistic sounds in primate (Macaca mulatta) auditory cortex we here investigate potential intrinsic references for decoding temporally precise information. Within the population of recorded neurons, we found one subset responding with stereotyped fast latencies that varied little across trials or stimuli, while the remaining neurons had stimulus-modulated responses with longer and variable latencies. Computational analysis demonstrated that the neurons with stereotyped short latencies constitute an effective temporal reference for relative coding. Using the response onset of a simultaneously recorded stereotyped neuron allowed decoding most of the stimulus information carried by onset latencies and the full spike train of stimulus-modulated neurons. Computational modeling showed that few tens of such stereotyped reference neurons suffice to recover nearly all information that would be available when decoding the same responses relative to the actual stimulus onset. These findings reveal an explicit neural signature of an intrinsic reference for decoding temporal response patterns in the auditory cortex of alert animals. Furthermore, they highlight a role for apparently unselective neurons as an early saliency signal that provides a temporal reference for extracting stimulus information from other neurons.},

abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},

abstract = {Use-dependent plasticity, thought to contribute to functional recovery after brain injury, is elicited by motor training. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of d-amphetamine facilitates the effects of motor training on use-dependent plasticity. Healthy human volunteers underwent a training period of voluntary thumb movements under the effects of placebo or d-amphetamine in different sessions in a randomized double-blind, counterbalanced design. Previous work in a drug-naive condition showed that such training causes changes in the direction of thumb movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation and in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electromyo- graphic responses. The endpoint measure of the study was the magnitude of training-induced changes in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked kinematic and electromyographic responses in the d-amphetamine and in the placebo con- ditions. Motor training resulted in increased magnitude, faster development and longer lasting duration of use-dependent plasticity under d-amphetamine compared to the placebo session. These results document a facilitatory effect of d-amphetamine on use-dependent plasticity, a possible mechanism mediating the beneficial effect of this drug on func- tional recovery after cortical lesions.

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

The evidence indicates that neither NMDA nor muscarinic receptors, nor NMDA receptor-mediated LTP, are required for spatial learning, although they might normally contribute to it. Detailed behavioral analyses have indicated that the water maze task is more complex than generally has been appreciated, and has a number of dissociable components. Naive rats trained under NMDA or muscarinic antagonism display sensorimotor disturbances that interfere with their ability to acquire the task. Rats made familiar with the general requirements of the task can learn the location of a hidden platform readily under NMDA or muscarinic antagonism. The ability of a rat to acquire the water maze task depends on its ability to apply instinctive behaviors to performance of the task in an adaptive manner. The instinctive behaviors undergo modification as the rat learns the general strategies required in the task. The evidence suggests that at least some of the plastic changes involved in acquiring the task occur in existing neural circuits situated in widespread areas of the brain, including sensory and motor structures in the cortex and elsewhere, and are therefore difficult to distinguish from existing sensorimotor mechanisms. More generally, the findings indicate the difficulty of inferring the occurrence or nonoccurrence of learning from behavior, and the difficulty of causally linking the action of particular receptor populations with the formation of specific memories.},

Behavioral measures of pitch discrimination and FFRs for all the stimuli were measured before and after the training phase for these participants, as well as for an untrained control group (n{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}={\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}12). Trained participants showed significant improvements in pitch discrimination compared to the control group for all three trained stimuli. These improvements were partly specific for stimuli with the same pitch modulation (dynamic vs. static) and with the same pitch trajectory (rising vs. falling) as the trained stimulus. Also, the robustness of FFR neural phase locking to the sound envelope increased significantly more in trained participants compared to the control group for the static and rising contour, but not for the falling contour. Changes in FFR strength were partly specific for stimuli with the same pitch modulation (dynamic vs. static) of the trained stimulus. Changes in FFR strength, however, were not specific for stimuli with the same pitch trajectory (rising vs. falling) as the trained stimulus. These findings indicate that even relatively low-level processes in the mature auditory system are subject to experience-related change.},

We measured the local field potential (LFP) and V1 spiking activity while monkeys performed an attention-demanding detection task. We show that gamma oscillations were strongly modulated by the stimulus and by attention. Stimuli that engaged inhibitory mechanisms induced the largest gamma LFP oscillations and the largest spike field coherence. Directing attention toward a visual stimulus at the receptive field of the recorded neurons decreased LFP gamma power and gamma spike field coherence. This decrease could reflect an attention-mediated reduction of surround inhibition. Changes in synchrony in V1 would thus be a byproduct of reduced inhibitory drive, rather than a mechanism that directly aids perceptual processing.},

abstract = {The ventral intraparietal area (VIP) of the macaque brain is a multimodal cortical region with directionally selective responses to visual and vestibular stimuli. To explore how these signals contribute to self-motion perception, neural activity in VIP was monitored while macaques performed a fine heading discrimination task based on vestibular, visual, or multisensory cues. For neurons with congruent visual and vestibular heading tuning, discrimination thresholds improved during multisensory stimulation, suggesting that VIP (like the medial superior temporal area; MSTd) may contribute to the improved perceptual discrimination seen during cue combination. Unlike MSTd, however, few VIP neurons showed opposite visual/vestibular tuning over the range of headings relevant to behavior, and those few cells showed reduced sensitivity under cue combination. Our data suggest that the heading tuning of some VIP neurons may be locally remodeled to increase the proportion of cells with congruent tuning over the behaviorally relevant stimulus range. VIP neurons also showed much stronger trial-by-trial correlations with perceptual decisions (choice probabilities; CPs) than MSTd neurons. While this may suggest that VIP neurons are more strongly linked to heading perception, we also find that correlated noise is much stronger among pairs of VIP neurons, with noise correlations averaging 0.14 in VIP as compared with 0.04 in MSTd. Thus, the large CPs in VIP could be a consequence of strong interneuronal correlations. Together, our findings suggest that VIP neurons show specializations that may make them well equipped to play a role in multisensory integration for heading perception.},

abstract = {Reference frames are important for understanding sensory processing in the cortex. Previous work showed that vestibular heading signals in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) are represented in body-centered coordinates. In contrast, vestibular heading tuning in the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) is approximately head centered. We considered the hypothesis that visual heading signals (from optic flow) in VIP might also be transformed into a body-centered representation, unlike visual heading tuning in MSTd, which is approximately eye centered. We distinguished among eye-centered, head-centered, and body-centered spatial reference frames by systematically varying both eye and head positions while rhesus monkeys viewed optic flow stimuli depicting various headings. We found that heading tuning of VIP neurons based on optic flow generally shifted with eye position, indicating an eye-centered spatial reference frame. This is similar to the representation of visual heading signals in MSTd, but contrasts sharply with the body-centered representation of vestibular heading signals in VIP. These findings demonstrate a clear dissociation between the spatial reference frames of visual and vestibular signals in VIP, and emphasize that frames of reference for neurons in parietal cortex can depend on the type of sensory stimulation.},

Vestibular heading tuning in VIP is invariant to changes in both eye and head positions, indicating a body (or world)-centered reference frame.

abstract = {Attention influences visual processing in striate and extrastriate cortex, which has been extensively studied for spatial-, object-, and feature-based attention. Most studies exploring neural signatures of feature-based attention have trained animals to attend to an object identified by a certain feature and ignore objects/displays identified by a different feature. Little is known about the effects of feature-selective attention, where subjects attend to one stimulus feature domain (e.g., color) of an object while features from different domains (e.g., direction of motion) of the same object are ignored. To study this type of feature-selective attention in area MT in the middle temporal sulcus, we trained macaque monkeys to either attend to and report the direction of motion of a moving sine wave grating (a feature for which MT neurons display strong selectivity) or attend to and report its color (a feature for which MT neurons have very limited selectivity). We hypothesized that neurons would upregulate their firing rate during attend-direction conditions compared with attend-color conditions. We found that feature-selective attention significantly affected 22{\%} of MT neurons. Contrary to our hypothesis, these neurons did not necessarily increase firing rate when animals attended to direction of motion but fell into one of two classes. In one class, attention to color increased the gain of stimulus-induced responses compared with attend-direction conditions. The other class displayed the opposite effects. Feature-selective activity modulations occurred earlier in neurons modulated by attention to color compared with neurons modulated by attention to motion direction. Thus feature-selective attention influences neuronal processing in macaque area MT but often exhibited a mismatch between the preferred stimulus dimension (direction of motion) and the preferred attention dimension (attention to color).},

Subjects had to compare a sample stimulus that had a fixed contrast of 30{\%} to a test stimulus that varied in contrast from trial to trial. Extensive practice yielded improvements in contrast discrimination that were observed across the full range of test stimulus contrasts. These improvements occurred across multiple sessions, as well as across trials within individual sessions. The finer the contrast discriminations required, the longer it took for subjects to improve. Improvements in psychophysical performance resulted in the steepening of psychometric functions and/or shifts in the point of subjective equality towards the contrast of the sample stimulus. Enhancement in discrimination was especially pronounced around the contrast level of the sample stimulus, to which the subject was consistently exposed. The changes resulted in increased accuracy overall, lower discrimination thresholds, and faster response times. Partial transfer of learning, from vertically oriented training stimuli to horizontally oriented testing stimuli, was observed, while transfer to stimuli with different spatial frequencies was less pronounced. The results demonstrate the existence of perceptual learning in the contrast domain, whereby learning affects multiple performance-related psychophysical metrics.},

abstract = {'Stimulus roving' refers to a paradigm in which the properties of the stimuli to be discriminated vary from trial to trial, rather than being kept constant throughout a block of trials. Rhesus monkeys have previously been shown to improve their contrast discrimination performance on a non-roving task, in which they had to report the contrast of a test stimulus relative to that of a fixed-contrast sample stimulus. Human psychophysics studies indicate that roving stimuli yield little or no perceptual learning. Here, we investigate how stimulus roving influences perceptual learning in macaque monkeys and how the addition of flankers alters performance under roving conditions. Animals were initially trained on a contrast discrimination task under non-roving conditions until their performance levels stabilized. The introduction of roving contrast conditions resulted in a pronounced drop in performance, which suggested that subjects initially failed to heed the sample contrast and performed the task using an internal memory reference. With training, significant improvements occurred, demonstrating that learning is possible under roving conditions. To investigate the notion of flanker-induced perceptual learning, flanker stimuli (30{\%} fixed-contrast iso-oriented collinear gratings) were presented jointly with central (roving) stimuli. Presentation of flanker stimuli yielded substantial performance improvements in one subject, but deteriorations in the other. Finally, after the removal of flankers, performance levels returned to their pre-flanker state in both subjects, indicating that the flanker-induced changes were contingent upon the continued presentation of flankers.},

Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80{\%} of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

Changes in the correlated firing of pairs of neurons may provide a metric of changes in functional circuitry during behavior. We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We found that identical visual stimuli give rise to differences in noise correlation in the two contexts, suggesting that MT neurons receive inputs of central origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The data are consistent with a mixed feature-based attentional strategy model in which the animal sometimes alternates attention between opposite directions of motion and sometimes attends to the two directions simultaneously. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The sensitivity of a population of neurons, and therefore the amount of sensory information available to an animal, is limited by the sensitivity of single neurons in the population and by noise correlation between neurons. For decades, therefore, neurophysiologists have devised increasingly clever and rigorous ways to measure these critical variables (Parker and Newsome, 1998). Previous studies examining the relationship between the responses of single middle temporal (MT) neurons and direction-discrimination performance uncovered an apparent paradox. Sensitivity measurements from single neurons suggested that small numbers of neurons may account for a monkey's psychophysical performance (Britten et al., 1992), but trial-to-trial variability in activity of single MT neurons are only weakly correlated with the monkey's behavior, suggesting that the monkey's decision must be based on the responses of many neurons (Britten et al., 1996). We suggest that the resolution to this paradox lies (1) in the long stimulus duration used in the original studies, which led to an overestimate of neural sensitivity relative to psychophysical sensitivity, and (2) mistaken assumptions (because no data were available) about the level of noise correlation in MT columns with opposite preferred directions. We therefore made new physiological and psychophysical measurements in a reaction time version of the direction-discrimination task that matches neural measurements to the actual decision time of the animals. These new data, considered together with our recent data on noise correlation in MT (Cohen and Newsome, 2008), provide a substantially improved account of psychometric performance in the direction-discrimination task.},

Previous studies have shown these correlations to be detrimental to the fidelity of population codes or at best marginally favorable compared to independent codes. Here, we show that positive correlations can enhance coding performance by astronomical factors. Specifically, the probability of discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude. Likewise, the number of stimuli encoded--the capacity--can be enhanced by similarly large factors. These effects do not necessitate unrealistic correlation values and can occur for populations with a few tens of neurons. We further show that both effects benefit from heterogeneity commonly seen in population activity. Error suppression and capacity enhancement rest upon a pattern of correlation. In the limit of perfect coding, this pattern leads to a `lock-in' of response probabilities that eliminates variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. We discuss the nature of this pattern and suggest experimental tests to identify it.},

This article reviews current progress in our understanding of the rodent prefrontal cortex, especially evidence for functional divergence of the anatomically distinct sub-regions of the rat prefrontal cortex. Recent findings suggest clear distinctions between the dorsal (precentral and anterior cingulate) and ventral (prelimbic, infralimbic and medial orbital) sub-divisions of the medial prefrontal cortex, and between the orbitofrontal cortex (ventral orbital, ventrolateral orbital, dorsal and ventral agranular cortices) and the adjacent medial wall of the prefrontal cortex. The dorso-medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in memory for motor responses, including response selection, and the temporal processing of information. Ventral regions of the medial prefrontal cortex are implicated in interrelated 'supervisory' attentional functions, including attention to stimulus features and task contingencies (or action-outcome rules), attentional set-shifting, and behavioural flexibility. The orbitofrontal cortex is implicated in lower-order discriminations, including reversal of stimulus-reward associations (reversal learning), and choice involving delayed reinforcement. It is anticipated that a greater understanding of the prefrontal cortex will come from using tasks that load specific cognitive and executive processes, in parallel with discovering new ways of manipulating the different sub-regions and neuromodulatory systems of the prefrontal cortex.},

abstract = {Attention increases our ability to detect behaviorally relevant stimuli. At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.},

By making small, real-time stimulus adjustments, we produced nearly identically retinal stimulation during controlled and free viewing.

We induced perceptual learning by Hebbian coactivation of the skin of the tip of the right index finger in humans. Under placebo, tactile two-point discrimination was improved on the coactivated but not on the left index finger. This augmentation was blocked by an N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor blocker, but doubled by amphetamine. No drug effects were found on the left index finger. The individual amount of cortical reorganization as assessed by mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials was linearly correlated with the pharmacological modulation of discrimination thresholds, implying that perceptual learning and associated cortical changes are controlled by basic mechanisms known to mediate and modulate synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {The amount of information encoded by networks of neurons critically depends on the correlation structure of their activity. Neurons with similar stimulus preferences tend to have higher noise correlations than others. In homogeneous populations of neurons, this limited range correlation structure is highly detrimental to the accuracy of a population code. Therefore, reduced spike count correlations under attention, after adaptation, or after learning have been interpreted as evidence for a more efficient population code. Here, we analyze the role of limited range correlations in more realistic, heterogeneous population models. We use Fisher information and maximum-likelihood decoding to show that reduced correlations do not necessarily improve encoding accuracy. In fact, in populations with more than a few hundred neurons, increasing the level of limited range correlations can substantially improve encoding accuracy. We found that this improvement results from a decrease in noise entropy that is associated with increasing correlations if the marginal distributions are unchanged. Surprisingly, for constant noise entropy and in the limit of large populations, the encoding accuracy is independent of both structure and magnitude of noise correlations.},

abstract = {Group decisions and even aggregation of multiple opinions lead to greater decision accuracy, a phenomenon known as collective wisdom. Little is known about the neural basis of collective wisdom and whether its benefits arise in late decision stages or in early sensory coding. Here, we use electroencephalography and multi-brain computing with twenty humans making perceptual decisions to show that combining neural activity across brains increases decision accuracy paralleling the improvements shown by aggregating the observers' opinions. Although the largest gains result from an optimal linear combination of neural decision variables across brains, a simpler neural majority decision rule, ubiquitous in human behavior, results in substantial benefits. In contrast, an extreme neural response rule, akin to a group following the most extreme opinion, results in the least improvement with group size. Analyses controlling for number of electrodes and time-points while increasing number of brains demonstrate unique benefits arising from integrating neural activity across different brains. The benefits of multi-brain integration are present in neural activity as early as 200 ms after stimulus presentation in lateral occipital sites and no additional benefits arise in decision related neural activity. Sensory-related neural activity can predict collective choices reached by aggregating individual opinions, voting results, and decision confidence as accurately as neural activity related to decision components. Estimation of the potential for the collective to execute fast decisions by combining information across numerous brains, a strategy prevalent in many animals, shows large time-savings. Together, the findings suggest that for perceptual decisions the neural activity supporting collective wisdom and decisions arises in early sensory stages and that many properties of collective cognition are explainable by the neural coding of information across multiple brains. Finally, our methods highlight the potential of multi-brain computing as a technique to rapidly and in parallel gather increased information about the environment as well as to access collective perceptual/cognitive choices and mental states.},

Although conventional wisdom considered sensory cortices as hard-wired, the specificity of improvement achieved through perceptual learning indicates an involvement of early sensory cortices. These cortices might be more plastic than previously assumed, and both sum-potential and single cell recordings indeed demonstrate plasticity of neuronal responses of these sensory cortices. However, for learning to be optimally useful, it must generalize to other tasks. Further research on perceptual learning should therefore, in my opinion, investigate first, the conditions for generalization of training-induced improvement, second, its use for teaching and rehabilitation, and third, its dependence on pharmacological agents.},

Outlines of two squares differing only in binocular disparity were used as test stimuli and estimates of stereoacuity were obtained by application of the method of constant stimuli with feedback. The peripheral thresholds of both subjects improved 60–80{\%} over the course of the first 3000–4000 responses at each stimulus location. Foveal improvement followed an identical time-course with a 73{\%} improvement in one subject and only 23{\%} in the other. This difference was reflected in the peripheral/foveal threshold ratios of the two subjects and underlines the necessity of ensuring the stability of thresholds. Stereoacuity measurements were also obtained using several different square separations at the fovea and at 2.5°, 5° and W peripheral locations along the horizontal and vertical retinal meridians of two other normal subjects. Practice-stabilized disparity thresholds using optimal target separations revealed a steeper deterioration between the fovea and 2.5–5° eccentricities than did measurements of the same subjects' minimum angles of resolution (MAR). The decrease of optimal stereoacuity at the more peripheral test locations was more gradual than has been previously reported but was not clearly related to that of the MAR.},

Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference.},

These studies are of great interest for neurological research because they demonstrate plasticity of the nervous system. Even for apparently basic perceptual tasks, such as visual acuity or vernier acuity, practice can facilitate a neural change which enhances performance. One question in this field is where does this learning occur? Indications about the possible neural site of a learning process may be derived from its specificity for some particular stimulus parameters. For instance, there is a hint that learning in global stereopsis may occur at a stage where visual information is processed by mechanisms selectively sensitive to different stimulus orientations. We report here an experiment on perceptual learning in the discrimination of gratings of different waveform. Our findings show that learning is specific for both the orientation and the spatial frequency of the practice stimulus.},

CLON (50 tzg/kg) administration completely blocked the NE response to both 20 and 30 mg/kg COC. By contrast, CLON decreased the NE response to 0.5 mg/kg AMPH by 75{\%}, but became progressively less effective on the response as the dose was increased to 1.75 and 5.0 mg/kg. CLON also had no effect on the caudate dopamine responses to either AMPH or COC, consistent with the presumed specificity of this drug for a 2 receptors and suggesting thc absence of any significant pharmacokinetic interactions. These results indicate that COC acts as an uptake blocker at NE-containing neurons and suggest that AMPH increases extracellular NE through two consequences of its interaction with the neuronal transport carrier: (1) reuptake blockade which predominates at lower doses; and (2) release which becomes more prevalent at higher doses. Behavioral analyses revealed effects of CLON which varied as a function of stimulant and dose.},

abstract = {Performance in visual discrimination tasks improves with practice. Although the psychophysical parameters of these improvements have suggested the involvement of early areas in visual cortex, there has been little direct study of the physiological correlates of such perceptual learning at the level of individual neurons. To examine how neuronal response properties in the early visual system may change with practice, we trained monkeys for more than 6 mo in an orientation discrimination task in which behaviorally relevant stimuli were restricted to a particular retinal location and oriented around a specific orientation. During training the monkeys' discrimination thresholds gradually improved to much better than those of naive monkeys or humans. Although this improvement was specific to the trained orientation, it showed little retinotopic specificity. The receptive field properties of single neurons from regions representing the trained location and a location in the opposite visual hemifield were measured in V1 and V2. In most respects the receptive field properties in the representations of the trained and untrained regions were indistinguishable. However, in the regions of V1 and V2 representing the trained location, there were slightly fewer neurons whose optimal orientation was near the trained orientation. This resulted in a small but significant decrease in the V1 population response to the trained orientation at the trained location. Consequently, the observed neuronal populations did not exhibit any orientation-specific biases sufficient to explain the orientation specificity of the behavioral improvement. Pooling models suggest that the behavioral improvement was accomplished with a task-dependent and orientation-selective pooling of unaltered signals from early visual neurons. These data suggest that, even for training with stimuli suited to the selectivities found in early areas of visual cortex, behavioral improvements can occur in the absence of pronounced changes in the physiology of those areas.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex exhibit well documented centre-surround receptive field organization, whereby the centre is dominated by excitatory influences and the surround is generally dominated by inhibitory influences. These effects have largely been established by measuring the output of neurons, i.e. their spiking activity. How excitation and inhibition are reflected in the local field potential (LFP) is little understood. As this can bear on the interpretation of human fMRI BOLD data and on our understanding of the mechanisms of local field potential oscillations, we measured spatial integration and centre-surround properties in single- and multiunit recordings of V1 in the awake fixating macaque monkey, and compared these to spectral power in different frequency bands of simultaneously recorded LFPs. We quantified centre-surround organization by determining the size of the summation and suppression area in spiking activity as well as in different frequency bands of the LFP, with the main focus on the gamma band. Gratings extending beyond the summation area usually inhibited spiking activity while the LFP gamma-band activity increased monotonically for all grating sizes. This increase was maximal for stimuli infringing upon the near classical receptive field surround, where suppression started to dominate spiking activity. Thus, suppressive influences in primary cortex can be inferred from spiking activity, but they also seem to affect specific features of gamma-band LFP activity.},

abstract = {We studied coactivation-based cortical plasticity at a psychophysical level in humans. For induction of plasticity, we used a protocol of simultaneous pairing of tactile stimulation to follow as closely as possible the idea of Hebbian learning. We reported previously that a few hours of tactile coactivation resulted in selective and reversible reorganization of receptive fields and cortical maps of the hindpaw representation of the somatosensory cortex of adult rats (Godde et al., 1996). In the present study, simultaneous spatial two-point discrimination was tested on the tip of the right index finger in human subjects as a marker of plastic changes. After 2 hr of coactivation we found a significant improvement in discrimination performance that was reversible within 8 hr. Reduction of the duration of the coactivation protocol revealed that 30 min was not sufficient to drive plastic changes. Repeated application of coactivation over 3 consecutive days resulted in a delayed recovery indicating stabilization of the improvement over time. Perceptual changes were highly selective because no transfer of improved performance to fingers that were not stimulated was found. The results demonstrate the potential role of sensory input statistics (i.e., their probability of occurrence and spatiotemporal relationships) in the induction of cortical plasticity without involving cognitive factors such as attention or reinforcement.},

abstract = {Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

We examined the reliability of information inferred from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in macaque primary visual cortex. We considered a decoding framework that computes the likelihood of visual stimuli from a pattern of population activity by linearly combining neuronal responses and tested this framework for orientation estimation and discrimination. We derived a simple parametric decoder assuming neuronal independence and a more sophisticated empirical decoder that learned the structure of the measured neuronal response distributions, including their correlated variability. The empirical decoder used the structure of these response distributions to perform better than its parametric variant, indicating that their structure contains critical information for sensory decoding. These results show how neuronal responses can best be used to inform perceptual decision-making.},

abstract = {Action video game play benefits performance in an array of sensory, perceptual and attentional tasks that go well beyond the specifics of game play [1-9]. That a training regimen may induce improvements in so many different skills is notable as the majority of studies on training-induced learning report improvements on the trained task but limited transfer to other, even closely related tasks [10, but see also 11-13]. Here we ask whether improved probabilistic inference may explain such broad transfer. Using a visual perceptual decision making task [14,15], the present study shows for the first time that action video-game experience does indeed improve probabilistic inference. A neural model of this task [16] establishes how changing a single parameter, namely, the strength of the connections between the neural layer providing the momentary evidence and the layer integrating the evidence over time captures improvements in action-gamers behavior. These results were established in a visual, but also in a novel auditory task, indicating generalization across modalities. Thus, improved probabilistic inference provides a general mechanism for why action video game playing enhances performance in a wide variety of tasks. In addition, this mechanism may serve as a signature of training regimens that are likely to produce transfer of learning.},

Behavioral performance, however, relies on population activity, and the accuracy of a population code is constrained by correlated noise among neurons. We tested whether training changes interneuronal correlations in the dorsal medial superior temporal area, which is involved in multisensory heading perception. Pairs of single units were recorded simultaneously in two groups of subjects: animals trained extensively in a heading discrimination task, and "naive" animals that performed a passive fixation task. Correlated noise was significantly weaker in trained versus naive animals, which might be expected to improve coding efficiency. However, we show that the observed uniform reduction in noise correlations leads to little change in population coding efficiency when all neurons are decoded. Thus, global changes in correlated noise among sensory neurons may be insufficient to account for perceptual learning.},

abstract = {In normal vision, visual scenes are predictable, as they are both spatially and temporally redundant. Evidence suggests that the visual system may use the spatio-temporal regularities of the external world, available in the retinal signal, to extract information from the visual environment and better reconstruct current and future stimuli. We studied this by recording neuronal responses of primary visual cortex (area V1) in anaesthetized and paralysed macaques during the presentation of dynamic sequences of bars, in which spatio-temporal regularities and local information were independently manipulated. Most V1 neurons were significantly modulated by events prior to and distant from stimulation of their classical receptive fields (CRFs); many were more strongly tuned to prior and distant events than they were to CRFs bars; and several showed tuning to prior information without any CRF stimulation. Hence, V1 neurons do not simply analyse local contours, but impute local features to the visual world, on the basis of prior knowledge of a visual world in which useful information can be distributed widely in space and time.},

abstract = {Sequences of motor activity are encoded in many vertebrate brains by complex spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity; however, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the generation of these pre-motor patterns are poorly understood. In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song and recapitulates these sequences during sleep. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the 'grandmother cell' concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations.},

Simultaneous record- ing from large numbers of neurons is a prerequisite for understanding their cooperative behavior. Various recording techniques and spike separation methods are being used toward this goal. However, the error rates involved in spike separation have not yet been quantified. We studied the separation reliability of “tetrode” (4-wire electrode)- recorded spikes by monitoring simultaneously from the same cell intracellularly with a glass pipette and extracellularly with a tetrode. With manual spike sorting, we found a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, with errors typically ranging from 0 to 30{\%} depending on the amplitude and firing pattern of the cell, the similarity of the waveshapes of neighboring neurons, and the experience of the oper- ator. Performance using only a single wire was markedly lower, indicating the advantages of multiple-site monitoring techniques over single-wire recordings. For tetrode recordings, error rates were in- creased by burst activity and during periods of cellular synchrony. The lowest possible separation error rates were estimated by a search for the best ellipsoidal cluster shape. Human operator performance was significantly below the estimated optimum. Investigation of error distributions indicated that suboptimal performance was caused by inability of the operators to mark cluster boundaries accurately in a high-dimensional feature space. We therefore hypothesized that au- tomatic spike-sorting algorithms have the potential to significantly lower error rates. Implementation of a semi-automatic classification system confirms this suggestion, reducing errors close to the estimated optimum, in the range 0–8{\%}.},

Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.},

Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top-down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1.},

Processing along the feedforward hierarchy of areas, leading to increasingly complex represen- tations, is automatic and implicit, while conscious perception begins at the hierarchy's top, gradually re- turning downward as needed. Thus, our initial con- scious percept—vision at a glance—matches a high- level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying “forest before trees.” For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search “pop-out” is attributed to high areas, where large re- ceptive fields underlie spread attention detecting cat- egorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level spe- cific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

abstract = {Many behaviors are affected by rewards, undergoing long-term changes when rewards are different than predicted but remaining unchanged when rewards occur exactly as predicted. The discrepancy between reward occurrence and reward prediction is termed an 'error in reward prediction'. Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area are believed to be involved in reward-dependent behaviors. Consistent with this role, they are activated by rewards, and because they are activated more strongly by unpredicted than by predicted rewards they may play a role in learning. The present study investigated whether monkey dopamine neurons code an error in reward prediction during the course of learning. Dopamine neuron responses reflected the changes in reward prediction during individual learning episodes; dopamine neurons were activated by rewards during early trials, when errors were frequent and rewards unpredictable, but activation was progressively reduced as performance was consolidated and rewards became more predictable. These neurons were also activated when rewards occurred at unpredicted times and were depressed when rewards were omitted at the predicted times. Thus, dopamine neurons code errors in the prediction of both the occurrence and the time of rewards. In this respect, their responses resemble the teaching signals that have been employed in particularly efficient computational learning models.},

abstract = {Author SummarySensory systems communicate information to the brain — and brain areas communicate between themselves — via the electrical activities of their respective neurons. These activities are “noisy”: repeat presentations of the same stimulus do not yield to identical responses every time. Furthermore, the neurons' responses are not independent: the variability in their responses is typically correlated from cell to cell. How does this change the impact of the noise — for better or for worse? Our goal here is to classify (broadly) the sorts of noise correlations that are either good or bad for enabling populations of neurons to transmit information. This is helpful as there are many possibilities for the noise correlations, and the set of possibilities becomes large for even modestly sized neural populations. We prove mathematically that, for larger populations, there are many highly diverse ways that favorable correlations can occur. These often differ from the noise correlation structures that are typically identified as beneficial for information transmission – those that follow the so-called “sign rule.” Our results help in interpreting some recent data that seems puzzling from the perspective of this rule.},

abstract = {Mutual information is a principled non-linear measure of dependence between stochastic variables, which is widely used to study the selectivity of neural responses to external stimuli. Here we define and develop a set of novel statistical independence tests based on mutual information, which quantify the significance of neural selectivity to either single features or to multiple, potentially correlated stimulus features like those often present in naturalistic stimuli. If the values of different features are correlated during stimulus presentation, it is difficult to establish if one feature is genuinely encoded by the response, or if it instead appears to be encoded only as a side effect of its correlation with another genuinely represented feature. Our tests provide a way to disambiguate between these two possibilities. We use realistic simulations of neural responses tuned to one or more correlated stimulus features to investigate how limited sampling bias correction procedures affect the statistical power of such independence tests, and we characterize the regimes in which the distribution of information values under the null hypothesis can be approximated by simple distributions (Chi-square or Gaussian). Finally, we apply these tests to experimental data to determine the significance of tuning of the band limited power (BLP) of the gamma [30-100Hz] frequency range of the primary visual cortical local field potential to multiple correlated features during presentation of naturalistic movies. We show that gamma BLP carries significant, genuine information about orientation, space contrast and time contrast, despite the strong correlations between these features.},

abstract = {Learning-dependent cortical encoding has been well described in single neurons. But behaviorally relevant sensory signals drive the coordinated activity of millions of cortical neurons; whether learning produces stimulus-specific changes in population codes is unknown. Because the pattern of firing rate correlations between neurons--an emergent property of neural populations--can significantly impact encoding fidelity, we hypothesize that it is a target for learning. Using an associative learning procedure, we manipulated the behavioral relevance of natural acoustic signals and examined the evoked spiking activity in auditory cortical neurons in songbirds. We show that learning produces stimulus-specific changes in the pattern of interneuronal correlations that enhance the ability of neural populations to recognize signals relevant for behavior. This learning-dependent enhancement increases with population size. The results identify the pattern of interneuronal correlation in neural populations as a target of learning that can selectively enhance the representations of specific sensory signals.},

A major excitatory projection to VTA neurons originates in the medial prefrontal cortex, and several lines of evidence suggest that glutamatergic synapses on VTA neurons are activated and modified during exposure to psychostimulant drugs. Here, we report for the first time that amphetamine depresses excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto VTA neurons in the midbrain slice preparation. Unexpectedly, this depression is mediated not by activation of dopamine receptors, but instead by activation of serotonin receptors. Our findings suggest that an acute effect of amphetamine exposure is the release of serotonin in the VTA, which in turn modulates excitation of VTA neurons. This process may be an important early component of permanent changes occurring in the reward pathway that contribute to drug addiction.},

abstract = {An optimal choice among alternative behavioral options requires precise anticipatory representations of their possible outcomes. A fundamental question is how such anticipated outcomes are represented in the brain. Reward coding at the level of single cells in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) follows a more heterogeneous coding scheme than suggested by studies using functional MRI (fMRI) in humans. Using a combination of multivariate pattern classification and fMRI we show that the reward value of sensory cues can be decoded from distributed fMRI patterns in the OFC. This distributed representation is compatible with previous reports from animal electrophysiology that show that reward is encoded by different neural populations with opposing coding schemes. Importantly, the fMRI patterns representing specific values during anticipation are similar to those that emerge during the receipt of reward. Furthermore, we show that the degree of this coding similarity is related to subjects' ability to use value information to guide behavior. These findings narrow the gap between reward coding in humans and animals and corroborate the notion that value representations in OFC are independent of whether reward is anticipated or actually received.},

abstract = {The ability to discriminate between similar sensory stimuli relies on the amount of information encoded in sensory neuronal populations. Such information can be substantially reduced by correlated trial-to-trial variability. Noise correlations have been measured across a wide range of areas in the brain, but their origin is still far from clear. Here we show analytically and with simulations that optimal computation on inputs with limited information creates patterns of noise correlations that account for a broad range of experimental observations while at same time causing information to saturate in large neural populations. With the example of a network of V1 neurons extracting orientation from a noisy image, we illustrate to our knowledge the first generative model of noise correlations that is consistent both with neurophysiology and with behavioral thresholds, without invoking suboptimal encoding or decoding or internal sources of variability such as stochastic network dynamics or cortical state fluctuations. We further show that when information is limited at the input, both suboptimal connectivity and internal fluctuations could similarly reduce the asymptotic information, but they have qualitatively different effects on correlations leading to specific experimental predictions. Our study indicates that noise at the sensory periphery could have a major effect on cortical representations in widely studied discrimination tasks. It also provides an analytical framework to understand the functional relevance of different sources of experimentally measured correlations.},

We recorded visual responses simultaneously from three successive stages of the cat visual system: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), thalamic (LGN) relay cells, and simple cells in layer 4 of primary visual cortex. Spike count variability was lower than that of a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative refractory periods largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages. Our results show that cortical responses can be more reliable than previously thought. The differences in reliability in retina, LGN, and cortex can be explained by (1) decreasing firing rates and (2) decreasing absolute and relative refractory periods.},

We report remarkable long-term learning in a simple texture discrimination task where learning is specific for retinal input. This learning is (i) local (in a retinotopic sense), (ii) orientation specific but asymmetric (it is specific for background but not for target-element orientation), and (iii) strongly monocular (there is little interocular transfer of learning). Our results suggest that learning involves experience-dependent changes at a level of the visual system where monocularity and the retinotopic organization of the visual input are still retained and where different orientations are processed separately. These results can be interpreted in terms of local plasticity induced by retinal input in early visual processing in human adults, presumably at the level of orientation-gradient sensitive cells in primary visual cortex.},

However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.},

abstract = {To assess the interaction of dopamine and acetylcholine systems in the rat nucleus accumbens in response to direct D-amphetamine administration, in vivo microdialysis measures of acetylcholine were used during reverse dialysis of amphetamine alone and in combination with D1 and D2 receptor antagonists SCH 23390 and sulpiride, respectively. During a 15-min exposure to amphetamine (50 microM) in the nucleus accumbens, acetylcholine increased to 33{\%} above pre-infusion levels, became maximal at 15 min post-infusion (+41{\%}) and gradually returned to baseline levels by 60 min post-amphetamine. Conversely, amphetamine (1 mM) administration caused a biphasic change in acetylcholine release with a trend toward a decrease (-14{\%}) during exposure followed by a significant increase (+36{\%}) at 30 min post-amphetamine that returned to baseline levels by 60 min after infusion. The increases observed during amphetamine (50 microM) exposure and during recovery from amphetamine (1 mM) were both blocked by co-administration with the D1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (10 microM), but not with the D2 antagonist, sulpiride (10 microM). Co-infusion of sulpiride eliminated the trend toward reduced acetylcholine release observed during 1 mM amphetamine whereas co-administration of SCH 23390 potentiated this decrease. A possible tonic D1 facilitation of nucleus accumbens acetylcholine release was indicated by the consistent reductions in acetylcholine release observed during infusion of SCH 23390. These results suggest that amphetamine administration in the nucleus accumbens induces a bidirectional change in acetylcholine release that is dependent on dose and opposing effects of nucleus accumbens D1 and D2 activation. In general, relatively low doses of amphetamine administered into the nucleus accumbens caused an increase in acetylcholine release that was dependent on dopamine D1 receptors whereas higher doses of amphetamine resulted in a D2-mediated decrease.},

In particular, of substantial importance is cellular decision-making in which a cell chooses a fate or behavior on the basis of information conveyed in noisy external signals. For robust decoding, the crucial step is filtering out the noise inevitably added during information transmission. As a minimal and optimal implementation of such an information decoding process, the autocatalytic phosphorylation and autocatalytic dephosphorylation (aPadP) cycle was recently proposed. Here, we analyze the dynamical properties of the aPadP cycle in detail. We describe the dynamical roles of the stationary and short-term responses in determining the efficiency of information decoding and clarify the optimality of the threshold value of the stationary response and its information-theoretical meaning. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the aPadP cycle against the receptor inactivation time and intrinsic noise. Finally, we discuss the relationship among information decoding with information-dependent actions, bet-hedging and network modularity.},

Neurons in contralateral barrel cortex were sampled with a microelectrode array 3.5 days later. Stimulation of clipped vibrissae produced a narrow spatial distribution of cortical activity, whereas stimulation of intact vibrissae produced a widened spatial distribution. Simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical barrel- columns suggest that changes in the effective connectivity between barrel-columns may partially account for this redistribution of sensory responses. Evidence is also presented for a second mech- anism, a release from inhibition in sensory-deprived cortical areas. A model is therefore proposed where these two mechanisms operate together to regulate the cortical distribution of evoked activity.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses of sensory cortex are highly variable, and this variability is correlated across neurons. To assess how variability reflects factors shared across a neuronal population, we analyzed the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons in visual cortex. We developed a simple model that comprises two sources of shared variability: a multiplicative gain, which uniformly scales each neuron's sensory drive, and an additive offset, which affects different neurons to different degrees. This model captured the variability of spike counts and reproduced the dependence of pairwise correlations on neuronal tuning and stimulus orientation. The relative contributions of the additive and multiplicative fluctuations could vary over time and had marked impact on population coding. These observations indicate that shared variability of neuronal populations in sensory cortex can be largely explained by two factors that modulate the whole population.},

abstract = {A three month project applying information theoretic techniques to a dataset of spiking activity collected from Multi-Electrode Arrays in visual cortex regions V1 and V4, for two macaque monkeys is described. We consider how the mutual information between the spiking activity patterns of individual neurons and the contrast of the presented stimulus changes with learning. In particular, a spike timing neural code is compared to a spike count code, and it is found that the spike timing code only offers more information during the onset transient response, and this is additional information does not change with learning. The effects of perceptual learning on coarse and fine contrast discrimination is also explored within the information theoretic framework, and it is found that there is no increase information in the spike-trains of individual neurons for either fine or coarse discrimination for V1, and in V4 there is an increase only for coarse discrimination. For coarse discrimination in V4, the results also indicate there is a decrease in the latency of information, which we believe to be an entirely novel result, though current work only finds this in one of the two monkeys in the study. Along the way, several problems inherent to the dataset had to be overcome, and a novel method of removing periodic artifacts from spiking data is proposed and utilised.},

abstract = {A single nicotine exposure increases dopamine levels in the mesolimbic reward system for hours, but nicotine concentrations experienced by smokers desensitize nAChRs on dopamine neurons in seconds to minutes. Here, we show that persistent modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission by nicotine can contribute to the sustained increase in dopamine neuron excitability. Nicotine enhances GABAergic transmission transiently, which is followed by a persistent depression of these inhibitory inputs due to nAChR desensitization. Simultaneously, nicotine enhances glutamatergic transmission through nAChRs that desensitize less than those on GABA neurons. The net effect is a shift toward excitation of the dopamine reward system. These results suggest that spatial and temporal differences in nicotinic receptor activity on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in reward areas coordinate to reinforce nicotine self-administration.},

abstract = {Images on the retina can change drastically in only a few milliseconds. A robust description of visual temporal processing is therefore necessary to understand visual analysis in the real world. To this end, we studied subsecond visual changes and asked how prefrontal neurons in monkeys respond to stimuli presented in quick succession. We recorded the visual responses of single neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF), a prefrontal area polysynaptically removed from the retina that is involved with higher level cognition. For comparison, we also recorded from small groups of neurons in the superficial superior colliculus (supSC), an area that receives direct retinal input. Two sequential flashes of light at varying interstimulus intervals were presented in a neuron's receptive field. We found pervasive neuronal adaptation in FEF and supSC. Visual responses to the second stimulus were diminished for up to half a second after the first stimulus presentation. Adaptation required a similar amount of time to return to full responsiveness in both structures, but there was significantly more neuronal adaptation overall in FEF. Adaptation was not affected by saccades, although visual responses to single stimuli were transiently suppressed postsaccadically. Our FEF and supSC results systematically document subsecond visual adaptation in prefrontal cortex and show that this adaptation is comparable to, but stronger than, adaptation found earlier in the visual system.},

abstract = {Attention typically amplifies neuronal responses evoked by task-relevant stimuli while attenuating responses to task-irrelevant distracters. In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency ({\textless}5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate.},

abstract = {Computational strategies used by the brain strongly depend on the amount of information that can be stored in population activity, which in turn strongly depends on the pattern of noise correlations. In vivo, noise correlations tend to be positive and proportional to the similarity in tuning properties. Such correlations are thought to limit information, which has led to the suggestion that decorrelation increases information. In contrast, we found, analytically and numerically, that decorrelation does not imply an increase in information. Instead, the only information-limiting correlations are what we refer to as differential correlations: correlations proportional to the product of the derivatives of the tuning curves. Unfortunately, differential correlations are likely to be very small and buried under correlations that do not limit information, making them particularly difficult to detect. We found, however, that the effect of differential correlations on information can be detected with relatively simple decoders.},

abstract = {Normal eye movements ensure that the visual world is seen episodically, as a series of often stationary images. In this paper we characterize the responses of neurons in striate cortex to stationary grating patterns presented with abrupt onset. These responses are distinctive. In most neurons the onset of a grating gives rise to a transient discharge that decays with a time constant of 100 msec or less. The early stages of response have higher contrast gain and higher response gain than later stages. Moreover, the variability of discharge during the onset transient is disproportionately low. These factors together make the onset transient an information-rich component of response, such that the detectability and discriminability of stationary gratings grows rapidly to an early peak, within 150 msec of the onset of the response in most neurons. The orientation selectivity of neurons estimated from the first 150 msec of discharge to a stationary grating is indistinguishable from the orientation selectivity estimated from longer segments of discharge to moving gratings. Moving gratings are ultimately more detectable than stationary ones, because responses to the former are continuously renewed. The principal characteristics of the response of a neuron to a stationary grating-the initial high discharge rate, which decays rapidly, and the change of contrast gain with time-are well captured by a model in which each excitatory synaptic event leads to an immediate reduction in synaptic gain, from which recovery is slow.},

abstract = {Summary Studies of visual processing in rodents have conventionally been performed on anesthetized animals, precluding examination of the effects of behavior on visually evoked responses. We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

abstract = {Humans and animals are exquisitely, though idiosyncratically, sensitive to risk or variance in the outcomes of their actions. Economic, psychological, and neural aspects of this are well studied when information about risk is provided explicitly. However, we must normally learn about outcomes from experience, through trial and error. Traditional models of such reinforcement learning focus on learning about the mean reward value of cues and ignore higher order moments such as variance. We used fMRI to test whether the neural correlates of human reinforcement learning are sensitive to experienced risk. Our analysis focused on anatomically delineated regions of a priori interest in the nucleus accumbens, where blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals have been suggested as correlating with quantities derived from reinforcement learning. We first provide unbiased evidence that the raw BOLD signal in these regions corresponds closely to a reward prediction error. We then derive from this signal the learned values of cues that predict rewards of equal mean but different variance and show that these values are indeed modulated by experienced risk. Moreover, a close neurometric-psychometric coupling exists between the fluctuations of the experience-based evaluations of risky options that we measured neurally and the fluctuations in behavioral risk aversion. This suggests that risk sensitivity is integral to human learning, illuminating economic models of choice, neuroscientific models of affective learning, and the workings of the underlying neural mechanisms.},

It is possible, however, to interpret the activity of relatively small numbers of cells in terms of meaningful aspects of the environment. 'Bayesian inference' provides a systematic and effective method of combining information from multiple cells to accomplish this. It is not a model of a neural mechanism (neither are alternative methods, such as the population vector approach) but a tool for analysing neural signals. It does not require difficult assumptions about the nature of the dimensions underlying cell selectivity, about the distribution and tuning of cell responses or about the way in which information is transmitted and processed. It can be applied to any parameter of neural activity (for example, firing rate or temporal pattern). In this review, we demonstrate the power of Bayesian analysis using examples of visual responses of neurons in primary visual and temporal cortices. We show that interaction between correlation in mean responses to different stimuli (signal) and correlation in response variability within stimuli (noise) can lead to marked improvement of stimulus discrimination using population responses.},

This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons, resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state.},

abstract = {Although the timing of single spikes is known to code for time-varying features of a sensory stimulus, it re- mains unclear whether time is also exploited in the neuronal coding of the spatial structure of the environ- ment, wherenontemporal stimulus features are funda- mental. This report demonstrates that, in the whisker representation of rat cortex, precise spike timing of single neurons increases the information transmitted about stimulus location by 44{\%}, compared to that transmitted only by the total number of spikes. Crucial to this code is the timing of the first spike after whisker movement. Complex, single neuron spike patterns play a smaller, synergistic role. Timing permits very few spikes to transmit high quantities of information about a behaviorally significant, spatial stimulus.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of various stimulus identification (decoding) procedures for extracting the information carried by the responses of a population of neurons to a set of repeatedly presented stimuli is studied analytically, in the limit of short time windows. It is shown that in this limit, the entire information content of the responses can sometimes be decoded, and when this is not the case, the lost information is quantified. In particular, the mutual information extracted by taking into account only the most likely stimulus in each trial turns out to be, if not equal, much closer to the true value than that calculated from all the probabilities that each of the possible stimuli in the set was the actual one. The relation between the mutual information extracted by decoding and the percentage of correct stimulus decodings is also derived analytically in the same limit, showing that the metric content index can be estimated reliably from a few cells recorded from brief periods. Computer simulations as well as the activity of real neurons recorded in the primate hippocampus serve to confirm these results and illustrate the utility and limitations of the approach.},

abstract = {In the insect olfactory system, oscillatory synchronization is functionally relevant and reflects the coherent activation of dynamic neural assemblies. We examined the role of such oscillatory synchronization in information transfer between networks in this system. The antennal lobe is the obligatory relay for olfactory afferent signals and generates oscillatory output. The mushroom body is responsible for formation and retrieval of olfactory and other memories. The format of odor representations differs significantly across these structures. Whereas representations are dense, dynamic, and seemingly redundant in the antennal lobe, they are sparse and carried by more selective neurons in the mushroom body. This transformation relies on a combination of oscillatory dynamics and intrinsic and circuit properties that act together to selectively filter and synthesize the output from the antennal lobe. These results provide direct support for the functional relevance of correlation codes and shed some light on the role of oscillatory synchronization in sensory networks.},

Here, we determine how information signaled by populations of neurons is modified by plasticity. Suprathreshold neuronal responses from a large number of neurons were recorded in the juvenile mouse barrel cortex using dithered random-access scanning. Pairing of one input with another resulted in a long-lasting, input-specific modification of the cortical responses. Mutual information analysis indicated that cortical plasticity efficiently changed information signaled by populations of neurons. The contribution of neural correlations to the change in mutual information was negative. The largest factor limiting fidelity of mutual information after pairing was a low reliability of the modified cortical responses.},

abstract = {We propose that the brain performs approximate probabilistic inference using nonlinear recurrent processing in redundant population codes. Different overlapping patterns of neural population activity encode the brain's estimates and uncertainties about latent variables that could explain its sense data. Nonlinear processing implicitly passes messages about these variables along a graph that determines which latent variables interact according to an internal model of the world. Since there are many equivalent neural implementations of this computation, we describe a general approach to identify the essential features of the neural algorithm. This approach uses dimensionality reduction in redundant codes to extract from the fine-grained neural signals how task-relevant variables are represented and transformed. To reveal these fundamental computations, it is insufficient to record neural activity during simple tasks because such tasks do not probe the brain's structured internal model. Instead, core inferential brain functions can only be revealed by studying large-scale activity patterns during moderately complex, naturalistic behaviors.},

abstract = {We report experiments combining assessment of spatial tactile discrimination behavior and measurements of somatosensory-evoked potentials in human subjects before and after short-term plastic changes to demonstrate a causal link between the degree of altered performance and reorganization. Plastic changes were induced by a Hebbian coactivation protocol of simultaneous pairing of tactile stimuli. As a result of coactivation, spatial discrimination thresholds were lowered; however, the amount of discrimination improvement was variable across subjects. Analysis of somatosensory-evoked potentials revealed a significant, but also variable shift in the localization of the N20-dipole of the index finger that was coactivated. The Euclidean distance between the dipole pre- and post-coactivation was significantly larger on the coactivated side (mean 9.13 ± 3.4 mm) than on the control side (mean 4.90 ± 2.7 mm, P = 0.008). Changes of polar angles indicated a lateral and inferior shift on the postcentral gyrus of the left hemisphere representing the coactivated index finger. To explore how far the variability of improvement was reflected in the degree of reorganization, we correlated the perceptual changes with the N20-dipole shifts. We found that the changes in discrimination abilities could be predicted from the changes in dipole localization. Little gain in spatial discrimination was associated with small changes in dipole shifts. In contrast, subjects who showed a large cortical reorganization also had lowest thresholds. All changes were highly selective as no transfer to the index finger of the opposite, non-coactivated hand was found. Our results indicate that human spatial discrimination performance is subject to improvement on a short time scale by a Hebbian stimulation protocol without invoking training, attention, or reinforcement. Plastic processes related to the improvement were localized in primary somatosensory cortex and were scaled with the degree of the individual perceptual improvement.},

Coactivation on the right index finger (IF) for 3 hr lowered its spatial discrimination threshold. In parallel, blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals from the right IF representation in SI and SII enlarged. The individual threshold reduction was linearly correlated with the enlargement in SI, implying a close relation between altered discrimination and cortical reorganization. Controls consisting of a single-site stimulation did not affect thresholds and cortical maps. Accordingly, changes within distributed cortical networks based on Hebbian mechanisms alter the individual percept.},

abstract = {Sensory experience drives dramatic structural and functional plasticity in developing neurons. However, for single-neuron plasticity to optimally improve whole-network encoding of sensory information, changes must be coordinated between neurons to ensure a full range of stimuli is efficiently represented. Using two-photon calcium imaging to monitor evoked activity in over 100 neurons simultaneously, we investigate network-level changes in the developing Xenopus laevis tectum during visual training with motion stimuli. Training causes stimulus-specific changes in neuronal responses and interactions, resulting in improved population encoding. This plasticity is spatially structured, increasing tuning curve similarity and interactions among nearby neurons, and decreasing interactions among distant neurons. Training does not improve encoding by single clusters of similarly responding neurons, but improves encoding across clusters, indicating coordinated plasticity across the network. NMDA receptor blockade prevents coordinated plasticity, reduces clustering, and abolishes whole-network encoding improvement. We conclude that NMDA receptors support experience-dependent network self-organization, allowing efficient population coding of a diverse range of stimuli.},

It is proposed that this impressive performance depends in part on a fast learning process that uses relatively few examples and that occurs at an early processing stage in the visual pathway. This hypothesis is given support by the demonstration that it is possible to synthesize, from a small number of examples of a given task, a simple network that attains the required performance level. Psychophysical experiments agree with some of the key predictions of the model. In particular, fast stimulus-specific learning is found to take place in the human visual system, and this learning does not transfer between two slightly different hyperacuity tasks.},

This new method considers, in an exact way, the effects of high order spike train statistics, with no approximation involved, and it generalizes our previous work that was valid for short time windows and small populations. The new technique permits one to quantify the information transmitted if each cell were to convey fully independent information separately from the information available in the presence of synergy-redundancy effects. Synergy-redundancy effects are shown to arise from three possible contributions: a redundant contribution due to similarities in the mean response profiles of different cells; a synergistic stimulus-dependent correlational contribution quantifying the information content of changes of correlations with stimulus, and a stimulus-independent correlational contribution term that reflects interactions between the distribution of rates of individual cells and the average level of cross-correlation. We apply the new method to simultaneously recorded data from somatosensory and visual cortices. We demonstrate that it constitutes a reliable tool to determine the role of cross-correlated activity in stimulus coding even when high firing rate data (such as multi-unit recordings) are considered.},

abstract = {The primary sensory cortex is positioned at a confluence of bottom-up dedicated sensory inputs and top-down inputs related to higher-order sensory features, attentional state, and behavioral reinforcement. We tested whether topographic map plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex and a secondary auditory area, the suprarhinal auditory field, was controlled by the statistics of bottom-up sensory inputs or by top-down task-dependent influences. Rats were trained to attend to independent parameters, either frequency or intensity, within an identical set of auditory stimuli, allowing us to vary task demands while holding the bottom-up sensory inputs constant. We observed a clear double-dissociation in map plasticity in both cortical fields. Rats trained to attend to frequency cues exhibited an expanded representation of the target frequency range within the tonotopic map but no change in sound intensity encoding compared with controls. Rats trained to attend to intensity cues expressed an increased proportion of nonmonotonic intensity response profiles preferentially tuned to the target intensity range but no change in tonotopic map organization relative to controls. The degree of topographic map plasticity within the task-relevant stimulus dimension was correlated with the degree of perceptual learning for rats in both tasks. These data suggest that enduring receptive field plasticity in the adult auditory cortex may be shaped by task-specific top-down inputs that interact with bottom-up sensory inputs and reinforcement-based neuromodulator release. Top-down inputs might confer the selectivity necessary to modify a single feature representation without affecting other spatially organized feature representations embedded within the same neural circuitry.},

abstract = {The perceptual salience and visibility of image elements is influenced by other elements in their vicinity. The perceptual effect of image elements on an adjacent target element depends on their relative orientation. Collinear flanking elements usually improve sensitivity for the target element, whereas orthogonal elements have a weaker effect. It is believed that the collinear flankers exert these effects through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), but the precise mechanisms underlying these contextual interactions remain unknown. Here, we directly examined this question by recording the effects of flankers on the responses of V1 neurons at parafoveal representations while monkeys performed a fixation task or a contrast detection task. We found, unexpectedly, that collinear flankers reduce the monkeys' perceptual sensitivity for a central target element. This behavioral effect was explained by a flanker-induced increase in the activity of V1 neurons in the absence of the central target stimulus, which reduced the amplitude of the target response. Our results indicate that the dominant effect of collinear flankers in parafoveal vision is suppression and suggest that these suppressive effects are caused by a decrease in the dynamic range of neurons coding the central target.},

abstract = {The visual system encodes the features of visual stimuli as well as their behavioral relevance. Stimuli with a high luminance contrast evoke more activity in the visual cortex than stimuli with a low contrast. At the same time, attended stimuli evoke more activity than nonattended stimuli. There is a debate about how visual features and attention jointly determine neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Some studies suggested that attention increases apparent contrast (Reynolds et al., 2000), others that attention amplifies responses by a constant factor (Williford and Maunsell, 2006), and yet others that attention and contrast have largely additive effects (Buracas and Boynton, 2007; Thiele et al., 2009). The influence of attention on contrast sensitivity differs between neurons, raising the possibility that attention and contrast could be coded conjointly in a population of neurons. Here we investigate this possibility by recording neuronal activity at multiple sites in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys using multielectrode recording techniques and support vector machines to decode attended stimuli as well as stimulus contrast. We find that many, but not all, V1 neurons are influenced by attention and that the effects of attention and contrast are additive on average. Stimulus contrast can be decoded from neuronal responses not strongly modulated by attention, whereas the attended stimulus can be decoded as the difference in activity of cells that are influenced by attention and cells that are not. The success of the approach suggests that visual attention and stimulus contrast are represented by largely separable codes.},

abstract = {Neurons in the visual primary cortex (area V1) do not only code simple features but also whether image elements are attended or not. These attentional signals are weaker than the feature-selective responses, and their reliability may therefore be limited by the noisiness of neuronal responses. Here we show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention on a single trial from the activity of a small population of neurons in area V1. Previous studies suggested that correlations between the activities of neurons that are part of a population limit the information gain, but here we report that the impact of these noise correlations depends on the relative position of the neurons' receptive fields. Correlations reduce the benefit of pooling neuronal responses evoked by the same object but actually enhance the advantage of pooling responses evoked by different objects. These opposing effects cancelled each other at the population level, so that the net effect of the noise correlations was negligible and attention could be decoded reliably. Our results suggest that noise correlations are caused by large-scale fluctuations in cortical excitability, which can be removed by a comparison of the response strengths evoked by different objects.},

How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning is an instance of adult plasticity whereby training in a sensory (e.g., a visual task) results in neuronal changes leading to an improved ability to perform the task. Yet studies in primary visual cortex have found that changes in neuronal response properties were relatively modest. The present study examines the effects of training in an orientation discrimination task on the response properties of V4 neurons in awake rhesus monkeys. Results indicate that the changes induced in V4 are indeed larger than those in V1. Nonspecific effects of training included a decrease in response variance, and an increase in overall orientation selectivity in V4. The orientation-specific changes involved a local steepening in the orientation tuning curve around the trained orientation that selectively improved orientation discriminability at the trained orientation. Moreover, these changes were largely confined to the population of neurons whose orientation tuning was optimal for signaling small differences in orientation at the trained orientation. Finally, the modifications were restricted to the part of the tuning curve close to the trained orientation. Thus, we conclude that it is the most informative V4 neurons, those most directly involved in the discrimination, that are specifically modified by perceptual learning.},

@article{Reich2001,
abstract = {How do neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) encode the contrast of a visual stimulus? In this paper, the information that V1 responses convey about the con- trast of static visual stimuli is explicitly calculated. These responses often contain several easily distinguished temporal components, which will be called latency, transient, tonic, and off. Calculating the information about contrast conveyed in each component and in groups of components makes it possible to delineate aspects of the temporal structure that may be relevant for contrast encoding. The results indicate that as much or more contrast-related information is encoded into the temporal structure of spike train responses as into the firing rate and that the temporally coded information is manifested most strongly in the latency to response onset. Transient, tonic, and off responses contribute relatively little. The results also reveal that temporal coding is important for distinguishing subtle contrast differ- ences, whereas firing rates are useful for gross discrimination. This suggests that the temporal structure of neurons' responses may extend the dynamic range for contrast encoding in the primate visual system.},

abstract = {The amount of information a sensory neuron carries about a stimulus is directly related to response reliability. We recorded from individual neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) while presenting randomly modulated visual stimuli. The responses to repeated stimuli were reproducible, whereas the responses evoked by nonrepeated stimuli drawn from the same ensemble were variable. Stimulus-dependent information was quantified directly from the difference in entropy of these neural responses. We show that a single LGN cell can encode much more visual information than had been demonstrated previously, ranging from 15 to 102 bits/sec across our sample of cells. Information rate was correlated with the firing rate of the cell, for a consistent rate of 3.6 +/- 0.6 bits/spike (mean +/- SD). This information can primarily be attributed to the high temporal precision with which firing probability is modulated; many individual spikes were timed with better than 1 msec precision. We introduce a way to estimate the amount of information encoded in temporal patterns of firing, as distinct from the information in the time varying firing rate at any temporal resolution. Using this method, we find that temporal patterns sometimes introduce redundancy but often encode visual information. The contribution of temporal patterns ranged from -3.4 to +25.5 bits/sec or from -9.4 to +24.9{\%} of the total information content of the responses.},

We demonstrate that attention is better described as a mechanism by which task relevant information impacts on ongoing processing, while excluding task irrelevant information. We asked subjects to judge the orientation of a target relative to a reference, in a single and dual task setting. The target orientation percept was systematically influenced by the presentation of prior spatio-temporal context. We found that the sign of the context influence depended on target contrast, but its strength depended on the level of attention devoted to the task. Thus the effects of attention and contrast were fundamentally different; contrast influenced the sign of contextual interactions, while attention suppressed these interactions irrespective of their sign.},

abstract = {Recent in vitro studies have shown that acetylcholine (ACh) selectively reduces the efficacy of lateral cortical connections via a muscarinic mechanism, while boosting the efficacy of thalamocortical/feed-forward connections via a nicotinic mechanism. This suggests that high levels of ACh should reduce center-surround interactions of neurons in primary visual cortex, making cells more reliant on feed-forward information. In line with this hypothesis, we show that local iontophoretic application of ACh in primate primary visual cortex reduced the extent of spatial integration, assessed by recording a neurons' length tuning. When ACh was externally applied, neurons' preferred length shifted toward shorter bars, showing reduced impact of the extra-classical receptive field. We fitted a difference and a ratio of Gaussian model to these data to determine the underlying mechanisms of this dynamic change of spatial integration. These models assume overlapping summation and suppression areas with different widths and gains to be responsible for spatial integration and size tuning. ACh significantly reduced the extent of the summation area, but had no significant effect on the extent of the suppression area. In line with previous studies, we also show that applying ACh enhanced the response in the majority of cells, especially in the later (sustained) part of the response. These findings are similar to effects of attention on neuronal activity. The natural release of ACh is strongly linked with states of arousal and attention. Our results may therefore be relevant to the neurobiological mechanism of attention.},

abstract = {Animal learning is associated with changes in the efficacy of connections between neurons. The rules that govern this plasticity can be tested in neural networks. Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. AGREL is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

Most of the information turns out to be encoded by the firing rates of the neurons, that is by the number of spikes in a short time window. This has been shown to be a robust code, for the firing rate representations of different neurons are close to independent for small populations of neurons. Moreover, the information can be read fast from such encoding, in as little as 20 ms. In quantitative information theoretic studies, only a little additional information is available in temporal encoding involving stimulus-dependent synchronization of different neurons, or the timing of spikes within the spike train of a single neuron. Feature binding appears to be solved by feature combination neurons rather than by temporal synchrony. The code is sparse distributed, with the spike firing rate distributions close to exponential or gamma. A feature of the code is that it can be read by neurons that take a synaptically weighted sum of their inputs. This dot product decoding is biologically plausible. Understanding the neural code is fundamental to understanding not only how the cortex represents, but also processes, information.},

A key component of this sensory task is that the second stimulus is compared with the trace left by the first (base) stimulus, which must involve working memory. Where and how is this trace held in the brain? This question was investigated by recording from single neurons in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys while they performed the somatosensory discrimination task. Here we describe neurons in the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex whose discharge rates varied, during the delay period between the two stimuli, as a monotonic function of the base stimulus frequency. We describe this as 'monotonic stimulus encoding', and we suggest that the result may generalize: monotonic stimulus encoding may be the basic representation of one-dimensional sensory stimulus quantities in working memory. Thus we predict that other behavioural tasks that require ordinal comparisons between scalar analogue stimuli would give rise to monotonic responses similar to those reported here.},

@article{Rothman2006,
abstract = {The abuse of illicit stimulants is a worldwide crisis, yet few medicines are available for treating stimulant addiction. We have advocated the idea of "agonist therapy" for cocaine dependence. This strategy involves administration of stimulant-like medications (e.g., monoamine releasers) to alleviate cocaine withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. A chief limitation of this strategy is that many candidate medicines possess high abuse liability due to activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons in reward pathways. Evidence suggests that serotonin (5-HT) neurons can provide an inhibitory influence over mesolimbic DA neurons. Thus, it might be predicted that the balance between DA and 5-HT transmission is a critical variable when developing medications with reduced stimulant side effects. In this article, we review recent studies from our laboratory that examined neurochemical and behavioral effects of a series of monoamine releasers which displayed different potencies at DA and 5-HT transporters. The data show that increasing 5-HT release can attenuate stimulant effects mediated by DA release, such as motor stimulation and drug self-administration. Our findings support the work of others and indicate that elevated synaptic 5-HT can dampen certain behavioral effects of DA-releasing agents. Moreover, the relationship between DA and 5-HT releasing potency is an important determinant in developing new agonist medications with reduced stimulant properties.},

abstract = {Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. NMDAR antagonists like ketamine induce schizophrenia-like features in humans. In rodent studies, NMDAR antagonism impairs learning by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This study investigated the effects of ketamine on spatial learning (acquisition) vs retrieval in a virtual Morris water task in humans. Verbal fluency, working memory, and learning and memory of verbal information were also assessed. Healthy human subjects participated in this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. On two separate occasions, ketamine/placebo was administered and cognitive tasks were assessed in association with behavioral ratings. Ketamine impaired learning of spatial and verbal information but retrieval of information learned prior to drug administration was preserved. Schizophrenia-like symptoms were significantly related to spatial and verbal learning performance. Ketamine did not significantly impair attention, verbal fluency, or verbal working memory task performance. Spatial working memory was slightly impaired. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for ketamine's differential impairment of verbal and spatial learning vs retrieval. By using the Morris water task, which is hippocampal-dependent, this study helps bridge the gap between nonhuman animal and human NMDAR antagonism research. Impaired cognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. A better understanding of NMDA antagonism, its physiological and cognitive consequences, may provide improved models of psychosis and cognitive therapeutics.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning in vision has been found to be highly specific for simple stimulus attributes, implying highly specific modifications in the nervous system. The type of specificity found (location, orientation, eye) implied plasticity at very early stages of visual processing, where processing modules were believed to be hard-wired and task independent. Recent studies show, however, that learning is task dependent. Studies examining the time course of learning indicate that at least two different learning processes are involved in perceptual learning, reflecting different levels of processing. Perceptual learning appears to be governed by associative rules and to be constrained by system architecture.},

abstract = {Successful navigation through the world requires accurate estimation of one's own speed. To derive this estimate, animals integrate visual speed gauged from optic flow and run speed gauged from proprioceptive and locomotor systems. The primary visual cortex (V1) carries signals related to visual speed, and its responses are also affected by run speed. To study how V1 combines these signals during navigation, we recorded from mice that traversed a virtual environment. Nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. These neurons performed a weighted sum of the two speeds. The weights were diverse across neurons, and typically positive. As a population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual and run speeds better than either visual or run speeds alone. These data indicate that V1 in the mouse participates in a multimodal processing system that integrates visual motion and locomotion during navigation.},

abstract = {The flutter sensation is felt when mechanical vibrations between 5 and 50 Hz are applied to the skin. Neurons with rapidly adapting properties in the somatosensory system of primates are driven very effectively by periodic flutter stimuli; their evoked spike trains typically have a periodic structure with highly regular time differences between spikes. A long-standing conjecture is that, such periodic structure may underlie a subject's capacity to discriminate the frequencies of periodic vibrotactile stimuli and that, in primary somatosensory areas, stimulus frequency is encoded by the regular time intervals between evoked spikes, not by the mean rate at which these are fired. We examined this hypothesis by analyzing extracellular recordings from primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices of awake monkeys performing a frequency discrimination task. We quantified stimulus-driven modulations in firing rate and in spike train periodicity, seeking to determine their relevance for frequency discrimination. We found that periodicity was extremely high in S1 but almost absent in S2. We also found that periodicity was enhanced when the stimuli were relevant for behavior. However, periodicity did not covary with psychophysical performance in single trials. On the other hand, rate modulations were similar in both areas, and with periodic and aperiodic stimuli, they were enhanced when stimuli were important for behavior, and were significantly correlated with psychophysical performance in single trials. Thus, the exquisitely timed, stimulus-driven spikes of primary somatosensory neurons may or may not contribute to the neural code for flutter frequency, but firing rate seems to be an important component of it.},

These improvements had been thought to occur only when attention is focused on the stimuli to be learned (task-relevant learning) but recent studies demonstrate performance improvements outside the focus of attention (task-irrelevant learning). Here, we propose a unified model that explains both task-relevant and task-irrelevant learning. The model suggests that long-term sensitivity enhancements to task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli occur as a result of timely interactions between diffused signals triggered by task performance and signals produced by stimulus presentation. The proposed mechanism uses multiple attentional and reinforcement systems that rely on different underlying neuromodulators. Our model provides insights into how neural modulators, attentional and reinforcement learning systems are related.},

These codes can be distinguished by examining the physiological basis of the highly irregular interspike intervals typically observed in cerebral cortex. Recent advances in our understanding of cortical microcircuitry suggest that the timing of neuronal spikes conveys little, if any, information. The cortex is likely to propagate a noisy rate code through redundant, patchy interconnections.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

abstract = {Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey. J Neurophysiol 86: 1916–1936, 2001. We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity predicted the monkey's di- rection judgment on both easy and difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF, stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that instructs such a response. The time course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye movement.},

Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {The response properties of neurons of the postero-medial barrel sub-field of the somatosensory cortex (the cortical structure receiving information from the mystacial vibrissae can be modified as a consequence of peripheral manipulations of the afferent activity. This plasticity depends on the integrity of the cortical cholinergic innervation, which originates at the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). The activity of the NBM is related to the behavioral state of the animal and the putative cholinergic neurons are activated by specific events, such as reward-related signals, during behavioral learning. Experimental studies on acetylcholine (ACh)-dependent cortical plasticity have shown that ACh is needed for both the induction and the expression of plastic modifications induced by sensory-cholinergic pairings. Here we review and discuss ACh-dependent plasticity and activity-dependent plasticity and ask whether these two mechanisms are linked. To address this question, we analyzed our data and tested whether changes mediated by ACh were activity-dependent. We show that ACh-dependent potentiation of response in the barrel cortex of rats observed after sensory-cholinergic pairing was not correlated to the changes in activity induced during pairing. Since these results suggest that the effect of ACh during pairing is not exerted through a direct control of the post-synaptic activity, we propose that ACh might induce its effect either pre- or post-synaptically through activation of second messenger cascades.},

Neurons in the inferior temporal cortex have been shown to be important in the representation of visual objects; however, it is unknown which object features are represented and how these representations are affected by categorization training. Here we show that feature selectivity in the macaque inferior temporal cortex is shaped by categorization of objects on the basis of their visual features. Specifically, we recorded from single neurons while monkeys performed a categorization task with two sets of parametric stimuli. Each stimulus set consisted of four varying features, but only two of the four were important for the categorization task (diagnostic features). We found enhanced neuronal representation of the diagnostic features relative to the non-diagnostic ones. These findings demonstrate that stimulus features important for categorization are instantiated in the activity of single units (neurons) in the primate inferior temporal cortex.},

abstract = {In natural viewing, a visual stimulus that is the target of attention is generally surrounded by many irrelevant distracters. Stimuli falling in the receptive field surround can influence the neuronal response evoked by a stimulus appearing within the classical receptive field. Such modulation by task-irrelevant distracters may degrade the target-related neuronal signal. We therefore examined whether directing attention to a target stimulus can reduce the influence of task-irrelevant distracters on neuronal response. We find that in area V4 attention to a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field filters out a large fraction of the suppression induced by distracters appearing in the surround. When attention is instead directed to the surround stimulus, suppression is increased, thereby filtering out part of the neuronal response to the irrelevant distracter positioned within the receptive field. These findings demonstrate that attention modulates the neural mechanisms that give rise to center-surround interactions.},

Recent work describes how such neural pat- terns are detected. By using non-linear membrane prop- erties, one set of target neurons, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, are able to act as coincidence detec- tors, sensitive to synchronized activity. In addition, the specific circuitry between the antennal lobe and the mushroom body refines the spatial–temporal selectivity of the Kenyon cells. In this process, the neural repre- sentation of odor identity is transformed from a dense spatial–temporal code into a sparse code.},

abstract = {We developed a novel design of an electrode-pipette combination (EPC) which allows access to brain structures in awake behaving primates without the need for guide tubes or to mechanically open the dura prior to electrode insertion. The EPC consists of an etched tungsten in glass electrode flanked by two pipettes which allow for local and highly controlled iontophoretic administration of neuroactive substances. These EPCs have excellent single cell isolation properties and are sturdy enough to penetrate the primate dura for up to 8 weeks following either a craniotomy or a dura scrape (i.e. even after substantial built up of fibrous scar tissue). We show that the EPCs can be used to selectively manipulate the cholinergic system in primate V1 during passive fixation and while animals perform an attentionally demanding task.},

To investigate the neural basis for this perceptual phenomenon, we recorded from directionally selective neurons in macaque visual area MT (middle temporal visual area). Contrast thresholds obtained for single gratings moving in a neuron's preferred direction were compared with those obtained for motion presented simultaneously in the neuron's preferred and antipreferred directions. A simple model based on probability summation between neurons tuned to opposite directions could sufficiently account for contrast thresholds revealed psychophysically, suggesting that area MT is likely to provide the neural basis for contrast detection of stimuli modulated in time.},

abstract = {Sensation, memories, and predictions contribute to choices in everyday life, and their relative impact should change with task constraints. To investigate how the impact from sensory cortex on decision making varies with task constraints we trained macaque monkeys in a direction discrimination task where they could maximize reward by waiting for sensory visual information early in a trial, while focusing on memory and reward prediction as a trial progressed. The task constraints caused animals to indicate decisions in complete absence of visual motion stimuli (stimulus independent decisions), as 25{\%} of the trials were 'no stimulus' trials. On 'no stimulus' trials reward delivery depended on the current decision in relation to the decision history. Stimulus independent decisions occurred during an epoch when a stimulus could in principle have been presented, or afterwards when stimuli could not occur anymore. Stimulus independent decisions were significantly different during these two periods. Reward exploitation was more efficient late in the trial, but it was not associated with systematic activity changes in directionally selective neurons in area MT. Conversely, systematic changes of neuronal activity and firing rate correlation in directionally selective middle temporal area (MT) neurons were restricted to a short time period before early decisions. Changing task constraints in the course of a single trial thus determines how neurons in sensory areas contribute to decision making.},

abstract = {Previous studies have proposed a variety of mechanisms by which attention influences neuronal activity. Here we investigated the mechanisms of attention in the striate cortex of monkeys performing a spatial or an object-based attention task at various stimulus contrasts and compared neuronal contrast response functions with and without attention. Our data are best described by an "additive" interaction: The influence of attention on the neuronal response is relatively independent of the stimulus contrast, at least when the stimulus has enough contrast to become visible. This shows that attention adds to the neuronal responses in a largely contrast invariant manner. These data support recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies and suggest that feedback from higher areas exerts a constant attentional drive that is mostly task not stimulus driven.},

abstract = {The ability to covertly select visual stimuli in our environment based on their behavioral relevance is an important skill. Stimulus selection has been studied experimentally, at the single neuron as well as at the population level, by recording from the visual cortex of subjects performing attention-demanding tasks, but studies at the local circuit level are lacking. We conducted simulations of a primary visual cortex (V1) model to provide insight into the local circuit computation underlying stimulus selection in V4. Two small oriented rectangular bars were placed at different locations in the 4 by 4 degree visual field represented by the V1 model, such that they activated different V1 neurons but such that they were both inside the classical receptive field (CRF) of the same V4 neuron. The biased competition framework [Desimone, R., {\&} Duncan, J. (1995). Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222] makes predictions for the response of V4 neurons and the modulation thereof by spatial and feature attention. In our simulation of the V1 network, we obtained results consistent with these predictions for V4 when the model had long-range excitatory projections targeting inhibitory neurons and when spatial attention was mediated by a spatially restricted projection that either inhibited the inhibitory neurons or excited the excitatory neurons. Although it is not clear whether attention effects measured in V4 neurons are generated mostly by local circuits within V4, our simulations suggest that spatial attention at a resolution less than the size of the CRF of a V4 neuron is inherited from upstream areas like V1 and relies on circuits mediating surround suppression at the single neuron level. Furthermore, the model displayed global oscillations in the alpha frequency range (around 10 Hz), whose coherence was highest in the absence of visual stimulation, which is consistent with electroencephalograms recorded in humans. By contrast, when a stimulus was presented the alpha oscillation sped up and became less coherent, whereas at the single column level (40-480 cells) transient beta/gamma oscillations were observed with a frequency between 25 and 50 Hz.},

Responses shifted relative to the expected reward value, and the gain adjusted to the variance of reward value. In this way, dopamine neurons maintained their reward sensitivity over a large range of reward values.},

abstract = {1. The possibility of temporal encoding in the spike trains of single neurons recorded in the temporal lobe visual cortical areas of rhesus macaques was analyzed with the use of principal component and information theory analyses of smoothed spike trains. The neurons analyzed had responses selective for faces. 2. Provided that a correction was applied to earlier methods of principal component analysis used for neuronal spike trains, it was shown that the first principal component provides by a great extent the most information, with the second and third adding only small proportions (on average 18.8 and 8.4{\%}, respectively). 3. It was shown that the magnitude of the second and higher principal components is even smaller if the spike train analysis is started after the onset of the neuronal response, instead of before the neuronal response has started. This suggests that variations in response latency are at least a part of what is reflected by the second and higher principal components. 4. The first principal component was correlated with the mean firing rate of the neurons. The second and higher principal components reflected at least partly the onset properties of the neuronal responses, such as response latency differences between the stimuli. 5. A considerable proportion of the information available from principal components 1-3 is available in the firing rate of the neuron. 6. Periods of the firing rate of as little as 50 or even 20 ms are sufficient to give a reasonable estimate of the firing rate of the neuron. 7. Information theory analysis showed that in short epochs (e.g., 50 ms) the information available from the firing rate can be as high, on average, as 84.4{\%} of that available from the firing rate calculated over 400 ms, and 52.0{\%} of that available from principal components 1-3 in the 400-ms period. It was also found that 44.0{\%} of the information calculated from the first three principal components is available in the firing rates calculated over epochs as short as 20 ms. 8. More information was available near the start of the neuronal response, and the information available from short epochs became less later in the neuronal response. 9. Taken together, these analyses provide evidence that a short period of firing taken close to the start of the neuronal response provides a reasonable proportion of the total information that would be available if a long period of neuronal firing (e.g., 400 ms) were utilized to extract it, even if temporal encoding were used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Sensory discriminations often improve with practice (perceptual learning). Recent results show that practice does not necessarily lead to the best possible performance on the task. It was shown that learning a task (contrast discrimination) that has already reached saturation could be enabled by a contextual change in the stimulus (the addition of surrounding flankers) during practice. Psychophysical results with varying context show a behavior that is described by a network of local visual processors with horizontal recurrent interactions. We describe a mathematical learning rule for the modification of cortical synapses that is inspired by the experimental results and apply it to recurrent cortical networks that respond to external stimuli. The model predicts that repeated presentation of the same stimulus leads to saturation of synaptic modification, such that the strengths of recurrent connections depend on the configuration of the stimulus but not on its amplitude. When a new stimulus is introduced, the modification is rekindled until a new equilibrium is reached. This effect may explain the saturation of perceptual learning when practicing a certain task repeatedly. We present simulations of contrast discrimination in a simplified model of a cortical column in the primary visual cortex and show that performance of the model is reminiscent of context-dependent perceptual learning.},

abstract = {The early stages of visual processing provide excellent models for the study of how information is represented in, and processed by, the activity of neurons. The fact that the retina contains both non-spiking and spiking neurons leads us to frame questions about neural coding in a general fashion, rather than in a manner specific either to point processes or continuous signals. In particular, we ask about the role of the statistical structure of the response, the extent to which the neural representation is 'literal', and how information content can be estimated from laboratory data. The broad theme that emerges from a review of experimental data is that each stage of visual processing is accompanied by new features, including adaptive filtering, feedback, rectification and spike generation. These dynamical elements allow an increasingly rich set of strategies for the representation and processing of visual information at retinal and thalamic levels.},

abstract = {1. We recorded single-unit and multi-unit activity in response to transient presentation of texture and grating patterns at 25 sites within the parafoveal representation of V1, V2, and V3 of two awake monkeys trained to perform a fixation task. In grating experiments, stimuli varied in orientation, spatial frequency, or both. In texture experiments, stimuli varied in contrast, check size, texture type, or pairs of these attributes. 2. To examine the nature and precision of temporal coding, we compared individual responses elicited by each set of stimuli in terms of two families of metrics. One family of metrics, D(spike), was sensitive to the absolute spike time (following stimulus onset). The second family of metrics, D(interval), was sensitive to the pattern of interspike intervals. In each family, the metrics depend on a parameter q, which expresses the precision of temporal coding. For q = 0, both metrics collapse into the "spike count" metric D(Count), which is sensitive to the number of impulses but insensitive to their position in time. 3. Each of these metrics, with values of q ranging from 0 to 512/s, was used to calculate the distance between all pairs of spike trains within each dataset. The extent of stimulus-specific clustering manifest in these pairwise distances was quantified by an information measure. Chance clustering was estimated by applying the same procedure to synthetic data sets in which responses were assigned randomly to the input stimuli. 4. Of the 352 data sets, 170 showed evidence of tuning via the spike count (q = 0) metric, 294 showed evidence of tuning via the spike time metric, 272 showed evidence of tuning via the spike interval metric to the stimulus attribute (contrast, check size, orientation, spatial frequency, or texture type) under study. Across the entire dataset, the information not attributable to chance clustering averaged 0.042 bits for the spike count metric, 0.171 bits for the optimal spike time metric, and 0.107 bits for the optimal spike interval metric. 5. The reciprocal of the optimal cost q serves as a measure of the temporal precision of temporal coding. In V1 and V2, with both metrics, temporal precision was highest for contrast (ca. 10-30 ms) and lowest for texture type (ca. 100 ms). This systematic dependence of q on stimulus attribute provides a possible mechanism for the simultaneous representation of multiple stimulus attributes in one spike train. 6. Our findings are inconsistent with Poisson models of spike trains. Synthetic data sets in which firing rate was governed by a time-dependent Poisson process matched to the observed poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) overestimated clustering induced by D(count) and, for low values of q, D(spike)[q] and D(intervals)[q]. Synthetic data sets constructed from a modified Poisson process, which preserved not only the PSTH but also spike count statistics accounted for the clustering induced by D(count) but underestimated the clustering induced by D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q].},

abstract = {One of the most critical challenges in systems neuroscience is determining the neural code. A principled framework for addressing this can be found in information theory. With this approach, one can determine whether a proposed code can account for the stimulus-response relationship. Specifically, one can compare the transmitted information between the stimulus and the hypothesized neural code with the transmitted information between the stimulus and the behavioral response. If the former is smaller than the latter (i.e., if the code cannot account for the behavior), the code can be ruled out. The information-theoretic index most widely used in this context is Shannon's mutual information. The Shannon test, however, is not ideal for this purpose: while the codes it will rule out are truly nonviable, there will be some nonviable codes that it will fail to rule out. Here we describe a wide range of alternative indices that can be used for ruling codes out. The range includes a continuum from Shannon information to measures of the performance of a Bayesian decoder. We analyze the relationship of these indices to each other and their complementary strengths and weaknesses for addressing this problem.},

abstract = {It is a common and good practice in experimental sciences to assess the statistical significance of measured outcomes. For this, the probability of obtaining the actual results is estimated under the assumption of an appropriately chosen null-hypothesis. If this probability is smaller than some threshold, the results are deemed statistically significant and the researchers are content in having revealed, within their own experimental domain, a "surprising" anomaly, possibly indicative of a hitherto hidden fragment of the underlying "ground-truth". What is often neglected, though, is the actual importance of these experimental outcomes for understanding the system under investigation. We illustrate this point by giving practical and intuitive examples from the field of systems neuroscience. Specifically, we use the notion of embeddedness to quantify the impact of a neuron's activity on its downstream neurons in the network. We show that the network response strongly depends on the embeddedness of stimulated neurons and that embeddedness is a key determinant of the importance of neuronal activity on local and downstream processing. We extrapolate these results to other fields in which networks are used as a theoretical framework.},

It is often claimed that this adaptive learning is highly task-specific, that is, we become more sensitive to the critical signals in the tasks we attend to. Here, we show a new type of perceptual learning, which occurs without attention, without awareness and without any task relevance. Subjects were repeatedly presented with a background motion signal so weak that its direction was not visible; the invisible motion was an irrelevant background to the central task that engaged the subject's attention. Despite being below the threshold of visibility and being irrelevant to the central task, the repetitive exposure improved performance specifically for the direction of the exposed motion when tested in a subsequent suprathreshold test. These results suggest that a frequently presented feature sensitizes the visual system merely owing to its frequency, not its relevance or salience.},

The results show a steady rise with eccentricity both for the stereothreshold and for the minimum target separations needed for uncrowded stereo performance.

It turns out that the form of response variability has a major impact on the encoding capacity and therefore plays an important role in the selection of an appropriate neural model. In particular, in the presence of baseline firing, the reconstruction error rapidly increases with D in the case of Poissonian noise but not for additive noise. The existence of limited-range correlations of the type found in cortical tissue yields a saturation of the Fisher information content as a function of the population size only for an additive noise model. We also show that random variability in the correlation coefficient within a neural population, as found empirically, considerably improves the average encoding quality. Finally, the representational accuracy of populations with inhomogeneous tuning properties, either with variability in the tuning widths or fragmented into specialized subpopulations, is superior to the case of identical and radially symmetric tuning curves usually considered in the literature.},

abstract = {Previous single-unit studies of visual cortex have reported that spatial attention modulates responses to different orientations and directions proportionally, such that it does not change the width of tuning functions for these properties. Other studies have suggested that spatial attention causes a leftward shift in contrast response functions, such that its effects on responses to stimuli of different contrasts are not proportional. We have further explored the effects of attention on stimulus-response functions by measuring the responses of 131 individual V4 neurons in two monkeys while they did a task that controlled their spatial attention. Each neuron was tested with a set of stimuli that spanned complete ranges of orientation and contrast during different states of attention. Consistent with earlier reports, attention scaled responses to preferred and nonpreferred orientations proportionally. However, we did not find compelling evidence that the effects were best described by a leftward shift of the contrast response function. The modulation of neuronal responses by attention was well described by either a leftward shift or proportional scaling of the contrast response function. Consideration of differences in experimental design and analysis that may have contributed to this discrepancy suggests that it was premature to exclude a proportional scaling of responses to different contrasts by attention in favor of a leftward shift of contrast response functions. The current results reopen the possibility that the effects of attention on stimulus-response functions are well described by a single proportional increase in a neuron's response to all stimuli.},

Although psychophysical studies suggest that perceptual learning induces similar changes in primary visual cortex (V1), studies that have measured the response properties of individual neurons have failed to find effects of the size described for the other sensory systems. We have examined the effect of learning on neuronal response properties in a visual area that lies at a later stage of cortical processing, area V4. Adult macaque monkeys were trained extensively on orientation discrimination at a specific retinal location using a narrow range of orientations. During the course of training, the subjects achieved substantial improvement in orientation discrimination that was primarily restricted to the trained location. After training, neurons in V4 with receptive fields overlapping the trained location had stronger responses and narrower orientation tuning curves than neurons with receptive fields in the opposite, untrained hemifield. The changes were most prominent for neurons that preferred orientations close to the trained range of orientations. These results provide the first demonstration of perceptual learning modifying basic neuronal response properties at an intermediate level of visual cortex and give insights into the distribution of plasticity across adult visual cortex.},

In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain's implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.},

Here we show that under experimental conditions nearly identical to those in the no-flanker practice experiment of Adini et al. (2002); practice significantly improved contrast discrimination. Moreover; in a separate experiment; we found that practice without flankers can improve contrast discrimination to a level only reached with flankers in Adini et al. (2002); but further practice with flankers produces no further improvement of contrast discrimination. These results call into question whether the “context-enabled learning” proposed by Adini et al. (2002) is different from regular contrast learning without flankers. In separate experiments; we found that contrast learning is tuned to spatial frequency; orientation; retinal location; and; unexpectedly; contrast. We also replicated Sagi; Adini; Tsodyks; and Wilkonsky's (2003) more recent finding that no regular contrast learning occurs if reference contrasts are randomly interleaved (contrast roving); and further demonstrated that flankers have no effect on contrast learning under contrast roving; another piece of evidence equating “context-enabled learning” to regular contrast learning. The contrast specificity of learning and the lack of learning under contrast roving provide new evidence in favor of a multiple contrast-selective channels model of contrast discrimination; and against saturating transducer models and multiplicative noise models.},

We propose that whether learning is location specific depends on the functional connections between high- level learning and the sensory inputs corresponding to the untrained retinal locations. These inputs may be suppressed by intensive training and focused (spatial) attention on the trained location to obstruct learning transfer. Here we present event-related potential (ERP) evidence that Vernier perceptual learning and its transfer are associated with P1 reduction and N1 enhancement. However, location specificity is only associated with N1 suppression corresponding to the untrained retinal location. These results are consistent with our proposal that the blockage of top-down influences or functional connections and the inhibition of visual inputs corresponding to untrained locations may contribute to location specificity in perceptual learning.},

abstract = {The flow of excitation through cortical columns has long since been predicted by studying the axonal projection patterns of excitatory neurones situated within different laminae. In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.},

abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold integrative processes that complement spike train measures. However, little is yet known about the differences between how LFPs and spikes encode rich naturalistic sensory stimuli. We addressed this question by recording LFPs and spikes from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques while presenting a color movie. We then determined how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies represents the visual features in the movie. We found that the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and 60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at frequencies {\textless}12 Hz. We further quantified "signal correlations" (correlations in the trial-averaged power response to different stimuli) and "noise correlations" (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same electrode. We found positive signal correlation between high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs, suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated within the same network. LFPs {\textless}24 Hz shared strong positive noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input. LFPs {\textless}40 Hz showed very little signal and noise correlations with LFPs {\textgreater}40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.},

abstract = {Studies analyzing sensory cortical processing or trying to decode brain activity often rely on a combination of different electrophysiological signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. Understanding the relation between these signals and sensory stimuli and between different components of these signals is hence of great interest. We here provide an analysis of LFPs and spiking activity recorded from visual and auditory cortex during stimulation with natural stimuli. In particular, we focus on the time scales on which different components of these signals are informative about the stimulus, and on the dependencies between different components of these signals. Addressing the first question, we find that stimulus information in low frequency bands ({\textless}12 Hz) is high, regardless of whether their energy is computed at the scale of milliseconds or seconds. Stimulus information in higher bands ({\textgreater}50 Hz), in contrast, is scale dependent, and is larger when the energy is averaged over several hundreds of milliseconds. Indeed, combined analysis of signal reliability and information revealed that the energy of slow LFP fluctuations is well related to the stimulus even when considering individual or few cycles, while the energy of fast LFP oscillations carries information only when averaged over many cycles. Addressing the second question, we find that stimulus information in different LFP bands, and in different LFP bands and spiking activity, is largely independent regardless of time scale or sensory system. Taken together, these findings suggest that different LFP bands represent dynamic natural stimuli on distinct time scales and together provide a potentially rich source of information for sensory processing or decoding brain activity.},

These dynamics are characterized by translaminar assemblies of neurons whose activity synchronizes rhythmically in space and time. How different cortical layers influence the formation of these spontaneous cellular assemblies is poorly understood. We found that excitatory neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers have distinct roles in the regulation of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations in mice in vivo. Optogenetic activation of infragranular neurons generated network activity that resembled spontaneous events, whereas photoinhibition of these same neurons substantially attenuated slow ongoing dynamics. In contrast, light activation and inhibition of supragranular cells had modest effects on spontaneous slow activity. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first causal demonstration that excitatory circuits located in distinct cortical layers differentially control spontaneous low-frequency dynamics.},

abstract = {Characterizing how different cortical rhythms interact and how their interaction changes with sensory stimulation is important to gather insights into how these rhythms are generated and what sensory function they may play. Concepts from information theory, such as Transfer Entropy (TE), offer principled ways to quantify the amount of causation between different frequency bands of the signal recorded from extracellular electrodes; yet these techniques are hard to apply to real data. To address the above issues, in this study we develop a method to compute fast and reliably the amount of TE from experimental time series of extracellular potentials. The method consisted in adapting efficiently the calculation of TE to analog signals and in providing appropriate sampling bias corrections. We then used this method to quantify the strength and significance of causal interaction between frequency bands of field potentials and spikes recorded from primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaques, both during spontaneous activity and during binocular presentation of naturalistic color movies. Causal interactions between different frequency bands were prominent when considering the signals at a fine (ms) temporal resolution, and happened with a very short (ms-scale) delay. The interactions were much less prominent and significant at coarser temporal resolutions. At high temporal resolution, we found strong bidirectional causal interactions between gamma-band (40-100 Hz) and slower field potentials when considering signals recorded within a distance of 2 mm. The interactions involving gamma bands signals were stronger during movie presentation than in absence of stimuli, suggesting a strong role of the gamma cycle in processing naturalistic stimuli. Moreover, the phase of gamma oscillations was playing a stronger role than their amplitude in increasing causations with slower field potentials and spikes during stimulation. The dominant direction of causality was mainly found in the direction from MUA or gamma frequency band signals to lower frequency signals, suggesting that hierarchical correlations between lower and higher frequency cortical rhythms are originated by the faster rhythms.},

We use methods of quantitative neuroanatomy to estimate the cortical circuit by defining the projection matrix between the various cells types of the neocortex of the cat, and then we consider the implications of this connectivity for cortical signal processing. Our analyses show that for a reasonable choice of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory efficacy, the overall cortical circuit lies near the border of dynamical stability. We discuss a model of co-operative competitive processing that is consistent with the observed connectivity in the superficial layers of the cortex, and consider also how the topology of the overall cortical circuit could be configured dynamically through average inhibition.},

abstract = {We developed a quantitative description of the circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the "weight" of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

abstract = {Field potential oscillations in the ∼10 Hz range are known as the alpha rhythm. The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.},

abstract = {The organization of local projections within the rat primary visual cortex (area 17) was investigated by tracing fibers with HRP in in vitro brain slices. The projections from different layers showed distinct laminar patterns. Layer 4 made a strong, topographically precise, projection to lower layer 2/3; weaker projections extended laterally and terminated diffusely in layer 2/3 but also ran vertically to layers 5 and 6. The connections of lower and upper layer 2/3 were reciprocal and point-to-point. Within layer 2/3, a large number of fibers ran horizontally and terminated at variable distances from the injection site without making terminal clusters. The main output from layer 2/3 was to layer 5. The most prominent projections from the upper half of layer 5 were to layers 2/3 and 6; lower layer 5, in contrast, made wide-ranging, clustered projections to layer 1, the bottom of layer 2/3, and the top of layers 4 and 5. The patches were 130-160 micron wide and spaced apart by 230-260 micron. The main projection that arose from the superficial layer 6 terminated in layer 4 above the injection site. In contrast, lower layer 6 made clustered projections to the layer 3/4 border, extending up to 2 mm in the coronal plane. The patches were 190-220 micron wide and spaced apart by 320-390 micron. Additional projections went to the layer 5/6 border and layers 1 and 2. These results indicate that geniculocortical input is processed through interlaminar connections that are topographically precise, widespread, or patchy. These connectivity patterns suggest a role for these connections in the transformation of functional maps between layers; focused projections preserve the architecture of the layers of origin, and diverging or patchy projections rearrange this organization and form new maps in the target layers (Lund: Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 11:253-288, '88). However, only a few interlaminar connections show one of these patterns in isolation, making it difficult to assign a single function to a particular connection. We, therefore, tentatively conclude that projections terminating in layers 1-4, with the possible exception of the connection between upper layer 6 and layer 4, transform functional maps. In contrast, the topographically precise projections from upper to lower layers preserve functional maps. The specific role of these connections in the construction of receptive field properties, however, is not known.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during “off-line” states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, “p-ripples,” which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

abstract = {The basic laminar organization of excitatory local circuitry in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey is similar to that described previously in the cat's visual cortex (Gilbert 1983). This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

There were 3 main findings. 1) We confirmed previously reported significant ventral-dorsal stream latency lags at the level of V4 (V4 mean = 38.7 ms vs. middle temporal mean = 26.9 ms) and inferotemporal cortex (IT mean = 43.4 ms vs. dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus mean = 33.9 ms). 2) We found that wavelength-sensitive inputs in areas V1, V4, and IT lagged the wavelength-insensitive responses by significant margins; this lag increased over successive levels of the system. 3) We found that laminar activation profiles in V4 and IT were inconsistent with "feedforward" input through the ascending ventral cortical pathway; the likely alternative input routes include both lateral inputs from the dorsal stream and direct inputs from nonspecific thalamic neurons. These findings support a "Framing" Model of ventral stream visual processing in which rapidly conducted inputs, mediated by one or more accessory pathways, modulate the processing of more slowly conducted feedforward inputs.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to both luminance and color and are integral to the transformation of color representation from retinal cone axes to perceptual hues. To isolate the coding and circuitry underlying this transformation, we employed the silent substitution method to minimize luminance-related responses. The silent substitution method depends on the choice of luminosity function, typically defined as sensitivity to a ratio of L and M cone subtypes. As the field has not agreed upon a unique luminosity function to study color representation in macaque V1, we began by testing whether the choice of luminosity function, human (1.5L + M) or macaque (1L + 1M, Dobkins et al. 2000), affects the quality of isolation of the color circuitry.We used intrinsic signal optical imaging to identify blob and interblob structures and measured single-unit responses via targeted multi-electrode arrays in anaesthetized macaque V1. Stimuli consisted of 4 Hz chromatically-modulated drifting gratings presented monocularly.Our initial results indicate that a heterogeny of luminosity functions are represented by V1 neurons, with a tendency for neurons with similar luminosity functions to cluster together in cortex. This finding is consistent with reports of local clustering of L and M cone subtypes in the human and macaque retina, suggesting that this spatial non-uniformity of spectral sensitivity persists in the color representation through to V1.},

Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call "globs," each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in "interglob" regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain.},

For example, during tasks engaging working memory (WM), specific oscillatory frequency bands modulate in space and time. Despite ample data correlating such modulation to task performance, a mechanistic explanation remains elusive. We propose that flexible control of neural oscillations provides a unified mechanism for the rapid and controlled transitions between the computational operations required by WM. We show in a spiking network model that modulating the input oscillation frequency sets the network in different operating modes: rapid memory access and load is enabled by the beta–gamma oscillations, maintaining a memory while ignoring distractors by the theta, rapid memory clearance by the alpha. The various frequency bands determine the dynamic gating regimes enabling the necessary operations for WM, whose succession explains the need for the complex oscillatory brain dynamics during effortful cognition.},

abstract = {The human spectral luminosity function (V-lambda) can he modeled as the linear sum of signals from long-wavelength-selective (L) and middle-wavelength-selective (M) cones, with L cones being weighted by a factor of similar to 2. This factor of similar to 2 is thought to reflect an approximate 2:1 ratio of L:M cones in the human retina, which has been supported by studies that allow for more direct counting of different cone types in the retina. In contrast to humans, several lines of retinally based evidence in macaques suggest an L:M ratio closer to 1:1. To investigate the consequences of differences in L:M cone ratios between humans and macaques, red-green equiluminance matches obtained psychophysically in humans (n = 11) were compared with those obtained electrophysiologically from single neurons in the extrastriate middle temporal visual area of macaques (M. mulatta, n = 5). Neurons in the middle temporal visual area were tested with sinusoidal red-green moving gratings across a range of luminance contrasts, with equiluminance being defined as the red-green contrast yielding a response minimum. Human subjects were tested under analogous conditions, by a minimally distinct motion technique, to establish psychophysical equiluminance. Although red-green equiluminance points in both humans and macaques were found to vary across individuals, the means across species differed significantly; compared with humans, macaque equiluminance points reflected relatively greater sensitivity to green. By means of a simple model based on equating the weighted sum of L and M cone signals, the observed red-green equiluminance points were found to be consistent with L:IM cone ratios of approximately 2:1 in humans and 1:1 in macaques. These data thus support retinally based estimates of L:M cone ratios and further demonstrate that the information carried in the cone mosaic has functional consequences for red-green spectral sensitivity revealed perceptually and in the dorsal stream of visual cortex.

First published December 20, 2006; doi:10.1152/jn.00845.2006. We present a new method, laminar population analysis (LPA), for analysis of laminar-electrode (linear multielectrode) data, where physiological constraints are explicitly incorporated in the mathematical model: the high-frequency band [multiunit activity (MUA)] is modeled as a sum over contributions from firing activity of multiple cortical populations, whereas the low-frequency band [local field potential (LFP)] is assumed to reflect the dendritic currents caused by synaptic inputs evoked by this firing. The method is applied to stimulus-averaged laminar-electrode data from barrel cortex of anesthetized rat after single whisker flicks. Two sample data sets, distinguished by stimulus paradigm, type of applied anesthesia, and electrical boundary conditions, are studied in detail. These data sets are well accounted for by a model with four cortical populations: one supragranular, one granular, and two infragranular populations. Population current source densities (CSDs; the CSD signatures after firing in a particular population) provided by LPA are further used to estimate the synaptic connection pattern between the various populations using a new LFP template-fitting technique, where LFP population templates are found by the electrostatic for- ward solution based on results from compartmental modeling of morphologically reconstructed neurons. Our analysis confirms previ- ous experimental findings regarding the synaptic connections from neurons in the granular layer onto neurons in the supragranular layers and provides predictions about other synaptic connections. Further- more, the time dependence of the stimulus-evoked population firing activity is predicted, and the temporal ordering of response onset is found to be compatible with earlier findings.

abstract = {High-frequency oscillations, known as sharp-wave/ripple (SPW-R) complexes occurring in hippocampus during slow-wave sleep (SWS), have been proposed to promote synaptic plasticity necessary for memory consolidation. We recorded sleep for 3 h after rats were trained on an odor-reward association task. Learning resulted in an increased number SPW-Rs during the first hour of post-learning SWS. The magnitude of ripple events and their duration were also elevated for up to 2 h after the newly formed memory. Rats that did not learn the discrimination during the training session did not show any change in SPW-Rs. Successful retrieval from remote memory was likewise accompanied by an increase in SPW-R density and magnitude, relative to the previously recorded baseline, but the effects were much shorter lasting and did not include increases in ripple duration and amplitude. A short-lasting increase of ripple activity was also observed when rats were rewarded for performing a motor component of the task only. There were no increases in ripple activity after habituation to the experimental environment. These experiments show that the characteristics of hippocampal high-frequency oscillations during SWS are affected by prior behavioral experience. Associative learning induces robust and sustained (up to 2 h) changes in several SPW-R characteristics, while after retrieval from remote memory or performance of a well-trained procedural aspect of the task, only transient changes in ripple density were induced.},

abstract = {In subjects suffering from early onset strabismus, signals conveyed by the two eyes are not perceived simultaneously but in alternation. We exploited this phenomenon of interocular suppression to investigate the neuronal correlate of binocular rivalry in primary visual cortex of awake strabismic cats. Monocularly presented stimuli that were readily perceived by the animal evoked synchronized discharges with an oscillatory patterning in the $\gamma$-frequency range. Upon dichoptic stimulation, neurons responding to the stimulus that continued to be perceived increased the synchronicity and the regularity of their oscillatory patterning while the reverse was true for neurons responding to the stimulus that was no longer perceived. These differential changes were not associated with modifications of discharge rate, suggesting that at early stages of visual processing the degree of synchronicity rather than the amplitude of responses determines which signals are perceived and control behavioral responses.},

abstract = {The notion of gating as a mechanism capable of controlling the flow of information from one set of neurons to another, has been studied in many regions of the central nervous system. In the nucleus accumbens, where evidence is especially clear, gating seems to rely on the action of bistable neurons, i.e., of neurons that oscillate between a quiescent “down” state and a firing “up” state, and that act as AND-gates relative to their entries. Independently from these observations, a growing body of evidence now indicates that bistable neurons are also quite abundant in the cortex, although their exact functions in the dynamics of the brain remain to be determined. Here, we propose that at least some of these bistable cortical neurons are part of circuits devoted to gating information flow within the cortex. We also suggest that currently available structural, electrophysiological, and imaging data support the existence of at least three different types of gating architectures. The first architecture involves gating directly by the cortex itself. The second architecture features circuits spanning the cortex and the thalamus. The third architecture extends itself through the cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus. These propositions highlight the variety of mechanisms that could regulate the passage of action potentials between cortical neurons sets. They also suggest that gating mechanisms require larger-scale neural circuitry to control the state of the gates themselves, in order to fit in the overall wiring of the brain and complement its dynamics.},

abstract = {SummaryBackground Simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural activity and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in primary visual cortex of anesthetized monkeys demonstrated varying degrees of correlation between fMRI signals and the different types of neural activity, such as local field potentials (LFPs), multiple-unit activity (MUA), and single-unit activity (SUA). One important question raised by the aforementioned investigation is whether the reported correlations also apply to alert subjects. Results Monkeys were trained to perform a fixation task while stimuli within the receptive field of each recording site were used to elicit neural responses followed by a {\{}BOLD{\}} response. We show – also in alert behaving monkeys – that although both {\{}LFP{\}} and {\{}MUA{\}} make significant contributions to the {\{}BOLD{\}} response, {\{}LFPs{\}} are better and more reliable predictors of the {\{}BOLD{\}} signal. Moreover, when {\{}MUA{\}} responses adapt but {\{}LFP{\}} remains unaffected, the {\{}BOLD{\}} signal remains unaltered. Conclusions The persistent coupling of the {\{}BOLD{\}} signal to the field potential when {\{}LFP{\}} and {\{}MUA{\}} have different time evolutions suggests that {\{}BOLD{\}} is primarily determined by the local processing of inputs in a given cortical area. In the alert animal the largest portion of the {\{}BOLD{\}} signal's variance is explained by an {\{}LFP{\}} range (20–60 Hz) that is most likely related to neuromodulation. Finally, the similarity of the results in alert and anesthetized subjects indicates that at least in {\{}V1{\}} anesthesia is not a confounding factor. This enables the comparison of human fMRI results with a plethora of electrophysiological results obtained in alert or anesthetized animals.},

@article{Grossberg1991,
abstract = {A neural network model of synchronized oscillator activity in visual cortex is presented in order to account for recent neurophysiological findings that such synchronization may reflect global properties of the stimulus. In these recent experiments, it was reported that synchronization of oscillatory firing responses to moving bar stimuli occurred not only for nearby neurons, but also occurred between neurons separated by several cortical columns (several mm of cortex) when these neurons shared some receptive field preferences specific to the stimuli. These results were obtained not only for single bar stimuli but also across two disconnected, but colinear, bars moving in the same direction. Our model and computer simulations obtain these synchrony results across both single and double bar stimuli. For the double bar case, synchronous oscillations are induced in the region between the bars, but no oscillations are induced in the regions beyond the stimuli. These results were achieved with cellular units that exhibit limit cycle oscillations for a robust range of input values, but which approach an equilibrium state when undriven. Single and double bar synchronization of these oscillators was achieved by different, but formally related, models of preattentive visual boundary segmentation and attentive visual object recognition, as well as nearest-neighbor and randomly coupled models. In preattentive visual segmentation, synchronous oscillations may reflect the binding of local feature detectors into a globally coherent grouping. In object recognition, synchronous oscillations may occur during an attentive resonant state that triggers new learning. These modelling results support earlier theoretical predictions of synchronous visual cortical oscillations and demonstrate the robustness of the mechanisms capable of generating synchrony.},

Here, we hypothesize that the L:M cone ratio should also influence red/green chromatic contrast sensitivity. To test this, in each subject we derived an estimate of L:M ratio based on her red/green equiluminance settings (obtained with heterochromatic flicker photometry), and measured both red/green chromatic and luminance contrast sensitivity at different spatial and temporal frequencies. Factor analysis was applied to the data in order to reveal covariance between conditions. As expected, chromatic and luminance contrast sensitivity were found to be independent of one another, and no relationship was observed between L:M ratio and luminance contrast sensitivity. However, a significant relationship was observed between L:M ratio and chromatic contrast sensitivity, wherein subjects possessing the most symmetrical L:M cone ratios (i.e., near 1:1) appear to possess the relatively greatest chromatic contrast sensitivity. This relationship can be accounted for by a simple model based on the notion of random L- and M-cone inputs to the center and surround receptive fields of chromatic (L-M) mechanisms.},

abstract = {A laminar distribution of different functional cell types in the striate cortex of the cat is drawn up from the visual responses of single cells recorded in 64 electrode penetrations in 38 cats. In summary, S cells were found to be concentrated in laminae 4 and 6; SH cells in laminae 2, 3 and 4; C cells in laminae 5 and lower 3; B cells in laminae 3 and upper 5 and cells with non-oriented receptive fields in lamina 4. In addition, the nature of afferent innervation to striate neurons was derived from the latency of the orthodromic response to electrical stimulation in the optic chiasm and optic radiations in 19 cats. An analysis of latency values allowed the afferent innervation to a cell to be classed as belonging either to fast or slow conducting streams in the population of dLGN axons and also permitted a decision to be made on whether or not the afferent path passed directly to the cell. Direct afferent innervation from the dLGN was not found to be confined to a single class of striate neuron. Instead, examples of cells with S, SH, C, B and non-oriented receptive fields all had orthodromic latencies that met the requirement for direct innervation. Instances of cells with orthodromic latencies suggestive of indirect innervation were also found for most receptive field classes but these cells were encountered less frequently than those with a direct afferent input. It is argued that a variety of different cell types may act as first order neurons in the striate cortex and that cells occurring at later stages in the sequence of cortical processing may have been incompletely studied because they are more difficult to stimulate either visually or electrically.},

Because of technical limitations it has remained unclear how these cells integrate widespread synaptic inputs located in distantly separated basal and tuft dendrites. Here, we obtained in vivo two-photon calcium imaging recordings from the entire dendritic field of layer 5 motor cortex neurons. We demonstrate that during subthreshold activity, basal and tuft dendrites exhibit spatially localized, small-amplitude calcium transients reflecting afferent synaptic inputs. During action potential firing, calcium signals in basal dendrites are linearly related to spike activity, whereas calcium signals in the tuft occur unreliably. However, in both dendritic compartments, spike-associated calcium signals were uniformly distributed throughout all branches. Thus, our data support a model of widespread, multibranch integration with a direct impact by basal dendrites and only a partial contribution on output signaling by the tuft.},

Cortical areas involved in vibrissal somatosensation and sensorimotor integration include the vibrissal area of the primary motor cortex (vM1), primary somatosensory cortex (vS1; barrel cortex), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). We mapped local excitatory pathways in each area across all cortical layers using glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation. We analyzed these maps to derive laminar connectivity matrices describing the average strengths of pathways between individual neurons in different layers and between entire cortical layers. In vM1, the strongest projection was L2/3→L5. In vS1, strong projections were L2/3→L5 and L4→L3. L6 input and output were weak in both areas. In S2, L2/3→L5 exceeded the strength of the ascending L4→L3 projection, and local input to L6 was prominent. The most conserved pathways were L2/3→L5, and the most variable were L4→L2/3 and pathways involving L6. Local excitatory circuits in different cortical areas are organized around a prominent descending pathway from L2/3→L5, suggesting that sensory cortices are elaborations on a basic motor cortex-like plan.},

abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with A$\beta$. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A$\beta$1–40 and A$\beta$1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice.

abstract = {Macaque monkeys are widely used as a model species for investigations of the biology of human vision. Previous measurements suggest that the cone-based spectral sensitivity of these two primates is greatly similar, but perhaps not identical. We measured the photopic spectral sensitivity of 42 male macaque monkeys from two species (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis) using an objective index, electroretinogram flicker photometry. The variations among individuals and between the two species were very small and there was no evidence for any significant cone pigment polymorphism in this sample. There are small but systematic differences in spectral sensitivity between macaque monkeys and equivalently tested human subjects--the monkeys were slightly more sensitive to short wavelengths ({\textless} 520 nm) and slightly less sensitive to wavelengths longer than this value. The results obtained from the curve fitting of standard photopigment absorption spectra to the spectral-sensitivity functions suggest that the difference between human and macaque monkey spectral sensitivity principally reflects differences in the relative proportions of the long- and middle-wavelength cones in the retinas of the two species.},

abstract = {Mapping neuronal responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is key to understanding how visual information is processed in the brain. This paper focuses on our current knowledge of the dynamics the receptive field (RF) as broken down into the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) in primate LGN. CRFs in the LGN are known to be similar to those in the retinal ganglion cell layer in terms of both spatial and temporal characteristics, leading to the standard interpretation of the LGN as a relay center from retina to primary visual cortex. ECRFs have generally been found to be large and inhibitory, with some differences in magnitude between the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways. The specific contributions of the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex to LGN ECRF properties are presently unknown. Some reports suggest a retinal origin for extra-classical suppression based on latency arguments and other reports have suggested a thalamic origin for extra-classical suppression. This issue is complicated by the use of anesthetized animals, where cortical activity is likely to be altered. Thus further study of LGN ECRFs is warranted to reconcile these discrepancies. Producing descriptions of RF properties of LGN neurons could be enhanced by employing preferred naturalistic stimuli. Although there has been significant work in cats with natural scene stimuli and noise that statistically imitates natural scenes, we highlight a need for similar data from primates. Obtaining these data may be aided by recent advancements in experimental and analytical techniques that permit the efficient study of nonlinear RF characteristics in addition to traditional linear factors. In light of the reviewed topics, we conclude by suggesting experiments to more clearly elucidate the spatial and temporal structure of ECRFs of primate LGN neurons. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Sensory systems must rely on powerful mechanisms for organizing complex information. We propose a framework in which inhibitory alpha oscillations limit and prioritize neuronal processing. At oscillatory peaks, inhibition prevents neuronal firing. As the inhibition ramps down within a cycle, a set of neuronal representations will activate sequentially according to their respective excitability. Both top-down and bottom-up drives determine excitability; in particular, spatial attention is a major top-down influence. On a shorter time scale, fast recurrent inhibition segments representations in slots 10-30ms apart, generating gamma-band activity at the population level. The proposed mechanism serves to convert spatially distributed representations in early visual regions to a temporal phase code: that is, 'to-do lists' that can be processed sequentially by downstream regions.},

abstract = {Both theoretical and experimental animal work supports the hypothesis that transient oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz) is closely associated with sensory processing. Recent data from recordings in animals and humans have suggested that gamma-frequency activity also has an important role in attention and both working and long-term memory. The involvement of gamma-band synchronization in various cognitive paradigms in humans is currently being investigated using intracranial and high-density electro- and magnetoencephalography recordings. Here, we discuss recent findings demonstrating human gamma-frequency activity associated with attention and memory in both sensory and non-sensory areas. Because oscillatory gamma-frequency activity has an important role in neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity, it could provide a key for understanding neuronal processing in both local and distributed cortical networks engaged in complex cognitive functions.

We found that the orientation preference of a cortical column is closely related to the population receptive field of its ON and OFF thalamic inputs. The receptive field scatter from the thalamic inputs was more limited than previously thought and matched the average receptive field size of neurons at the input layers of cortex. Moreover, the thalamic population receptive field (calculated as ON - OFF average) had separate ON and OFF subregions, similar to cortical neurons in layer 4, and provided an accurate prediction of the preferred orientation of the column. These results support developmental models of orientation maps that are based on the receptive field arrangement of ON and OFF visual inputs to cortex.},

LFPs supplement action potential recordings by indexing activity relevant to EEG, MEG and hemodynamic (fMRI) signals. Recent reports suggest that LFPs reflect activity within very small domains of several hundred microns. We examined this conclusion by comparing LFP, current source density (CSD), and multiunit activity (MUA) signals in macaque auditory cortex. Estimated by frequency tuning bandwidths, these signals' “listening areas” differ systematically with an order of: MUA {\textless} CSD {\textless} LFP. Computational analyses confirm that observed LFPs receive non-local contributions. Direct measurements indicate passive spread of LFPs to sites more than a centimeter from their origins. These findings appear to be independent of the frequency content of the LFP. Our results challenge the idea that LFP recordings typically integrate over extremely circumscribed local domains. Rather, LFPs appear as a mixture of local potentials with “volume conducted” potentials from distant sites.},

Nonetheless, there is little doubt that alpha-band oscillations also play an active role in information processing. In this article, I suggest that alpha-band oscillations have two roles (inhibition and timing) that are closely linked to two fundamental functions of attention (suppression and selection), which enable controlled knowledge access and semantic orientation (the ability to be consciously oriented in time, space, and context). As such, alpha-band oscillations reflect one of the most basic cognitive processes and can also be shown to play a key role in the coalescence of brain activity in different frequencies.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that {\{}EEG{\}} oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of {\{}EEG{\}} phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

abstract = {The role of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in visual encoding remains an open question. Here, we characterize the function of tonic and burst spikes in cat LGN X-cells in signaling features of natural stimuli. A significant increase in bursting was observed during natural stimulation (relative to white noise stimulation) and was linked to the strong correlation structure of the natural scene movies. Burst responses were triggered by specific stimulus events consisting of a prolonged inhibitory stimulus, followed by an excitatory stimulus, such as the movement of an object into the receptive field. LGN responses to natural scene movies were predicted using an integrate-and-fire (IF) framework and compared with experimentally observed responses. The standard IF model successfully predicted LGN responses to natural scene movies during tonic firing, indicating a linear relationship between stimulus and response. However, the IF model typically underpredicted the LGN response during periods of bursting, indicating a nonlinear amplification of the stimulus in the actual response. The addition of a burst mechanism to the IF model was necessary to accurately predict the entire LGN response. These results suggest that LGN bursts are an important part of the neural code, providing a nonlinear amplification of stimulus features that are typical of the natural environment.},

abstract = {In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, visual stimulation produces two distinct types of responses known as tonic and burst. Due to the dynamics of the T-type Ca(2+) channels involved in burst generation, the type of response evoked by a particular stimulus depends on the resting membrane potential, which is controlled by a network of modulatory connections from other brain areas. In this study, we use simulated responses to natural scene movies to describe how modulatory and stimulus-driven changes in LGN membrane potential interact to determine the luminance sequences that trigger burst responses. We find that at low resting potentials, when the T channels are de-inactivated and bursts are relatively frequent, an excitatory stimulus transient alone is sufficient to evoke a burst. However, to evoke a burst at high resting potentials, when the T channels are inactivated and bursts are relatively rare, prolonged inhibitory stimulation followed by an excitatory transient is required. We also observe evidence of these effects in vivo, where analysis of experimental recordings demonstrates that the luminance sequences that trigger bursts can vary dramatically with the overall burst percentage of the response. To characterize the functional consequences of the effects of resting potential on burst generation, we simulate LGN responses to different luminance sequences at a range of resting potentials with and without a mechanism for generating bursts. Using analysis based on signal detection theory, we show that bursts enhance detection of specific luminance sequences, ranging from the onset of excitatory sequences at low resting potentials to the offset of inhibitory sequences at high resting potentials. These results suggest a dynamic role for burst responses during visual processing that may change according to behavioral state.},

abstract = {Despite its century-old use, the interpretation of local field potentials (LFPs), the low-frequency part of electrical signals recorded in the brain, is still debated. In cortex the LFP appears to mainly stem from transmembrane neuronal currents following synaptic input, and obvious questions regarding the 'locality' of the LFP are: What is the size of the signal-generating region, i.e., the spatial reach, around a recording contact? How far does the LFP signal extend outside a synaptically activated neuronal population? And how do the answers depend on the temporal frequency of the LFP signal? Experimental inquiries have given conflicting results, and we here pursue a modeling approach based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme incorporating detailed reconstructed neuronal morphologies in precise calculations of population LFPs including thousands of neurons. The two key factors determining the frequency dependence of LFP are the spatial decay of the single-neuron LFP contribution and the conversion of synaptic input correlations into correlations between single-neuron LFP contributions. Both factors are seen to give low-pass filtering of the LFP signal power. For uncorrelated input only the first factor is relevant, and here a modest reduction ({\textless}50{\%}) in the spatial reach is observed for higher frequencies ({\textgreater}100 Hz) compared to the near-DC ([Formula: see text]) value of about [Formula: see text]. Much larger frequency-dependent effects are seen when populations of pyramidal neurons receive correlated and spatially asymmetric inputs: the low-frequency ([Formula: see text]) LFP power can here be an order of magnitude or more larger than at 60 Hz. Moreover, the low-frequency LFP components have larger spatial reach and extend further outside the active population than high-frequency components. Further, the spatial LFP profiles for such populations typically span the full vertical extent of the dendrites of neurons in the population. Our numerical findings are backed up by an intuitive simplified model for the generation of population LFP.},

abstract = {The recent development of large multielectrode recording arrays has made it affordable for an increasing number of laboratories to record from multiple brain regions simultaneously. The development of analytical tools for array data, however, lags behind these technological advances in hardware. In this paper, we present a method based on forward modeling for estimating current source density from electrophysiological signals recorded on a two-dimensional grid using multi-electrode rectangular arrays. This new method, which we call two-dimensional inverse Current Source Density (iCSD 2D), is based upon and extends our previous one- and three-dimensional techniques. We test several variants of our method, both on surrogate data generated from a collection of Gaussian sources, and on model data from a population of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons. We also apply the method to experimental data from the rat subiculum. The main advantages of the proposed method are the explicit specification of its assumptions, the possibility to include system-specific information as it becomes available, the ability to estimate CSD at the grid boundaries, and lower reconstruction errors when compared to the traditional approach. These features make iCSD 2D a substantial improvement over the approaches used so far and a powerful new tool for the analysis of multielectrode array data. We also provide a free GUI-based MATLAB toolbox to analyze and visualize our test data as well as user datasets.},

abstract = {Attempting to understand how the brain, as a whole, might be organized seems, for the first time, to be a serious topic of inquiry. One aspect of its neuronal organization that seems particularly central to global function is the rich thalamocortical interconnectivity, and most particularly the reciprocal nature of the thalamocortical neuronal loop function. Moreover, the interaction between the specific and non-specific thalamic loops suggests that rather than a gate into the brain, the thalamus represents a hub from which any site in the cortex can communicate with any other such site or sites. The goal of this paper is to explore the basic assumption that large-scale, temporal coincidence of specific and non-specific thalamic activity generates the functional states that characterize human cognition.},

abstract = {To combine insights obtained from electric field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking activity (MUA) we need a better understanding of the relative spatial summation of these indices of neuronal activity. Compared to MUA, the LFP has greater spatial coherence, resulting in lower spatial specificity and lower stimulus selectivity. A differential propagation of low- and high-frequency electric signals supposedly underlies this phenomenon, which could result from cortical tissue specifically attenuating higher frequencies, i.e., from a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. Here we directly measure the cortical impedance spectrum in vivo in monkey primary visual cortex. Our results show that impedance is independent of frequency, is homogeneous and tangentially isotropic within gray matter, and can be theoretically predicted assuming a pure-resistive conductor. We propose that the spatial summation of LFP and MUA is determined by the size of these signals' generators and the nature of neural events underlying them, rather than by biophysical properties of gray matter.},

These layers receive intrinsic interlaminar excitatory and inhibitory relays from layers 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5. We describe seven varieties of local circuit neurons with somata within layers 1-2/3A, and we compare the lateral scale of spread of the axons and dendrites of these neurons with the size of the columnar connectional patch domains made by the laterally spreading axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons within the superficial layers (Lund et al. [1993] Cerebral Cortex 3:148-162). We conclude from this comparison that all of the neurons have dendritic fields that are limited to single patch domains. Furthermore, only two of the seven local circuit neuron varieties have sufficient axon spread to influence territory beyond single domains, reaching into neighboring territory likely to differ in function from that occupied by their dendrites. We have identified descending projections from particular varieties to layers 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5 and to the white matter. We discuss the contributions that these interneurons may make to function within the superficial cortical layers, and we summarize our overall conclusions, so far, from our set of studies on interneurons within area V1 of the macaque.},

abstract = {I hope that this review of the internal anatomy of the monkey primary visual cortex makes clear the high degree of specialization that exists in each of the cortical laminae and their constituent neurons. Each lamina is driven by different patterns of relays from the LGN and by different patterns of intrinsic interlaminar projections. The elaborate laminar and intralaminar segregation of efferent neuron arrays suggests that the extraordinary precision of inter- and intralaminar connectivity provides a unique functional role for each set of efferent neurons. The organization of aspinous (presumed inhibitory) local circuit neurons suggests that they are highly specialized, and within each lamina and via interlaminar relays each variety may only accomplish a single, particular task. The cortex neuropil does not give the immediate impression of "random" networks, and if such exist, they must surely be between very tightly determined subgroups of neurons. Clearly a very detailed physiological exploration of V1 is still needed, with new consideration of thalamic axon function, of efferent neuron characteristics, of laminar differences, and of spatial organization of properties within laminae, in order to match known anatomical detail with function. The concept of columnar organization in cortical organization of V1 may eventually be redefined in more complex terms that accurately describe the anatomical and functional parcellation evident in cortical depth and perhaps may link it to a means by which a correlation of different aspects of the visual image is achieved.},

abstract = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

abstract = {The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has been used to identify efferent cells in area 17 of the macaque. Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 58 (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that several components of the mass neural activity contributing to the local field potential (LFP) can be partly separated by decomposing the LFP into nonoverlapping frequency bands. Although the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been found to correlate preferentially with specific frequency bands of the LFP, it is still unclear whether the BOLD signal relates to the activity expressed by each LFP band independently of the others or if, instead, it also reflects specific relationships among different bands. We investigated these issues by recording, simultaneously and with high spatiotemporal resolution, BOLD signal and LFP during spontaneous activity in early visual cortices of anesthetized monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We used information theory to characterize the statistical dependency between BOLD and LFP. We found that the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (18-30 Hz), and gamma (40-100 Hz) LFP bands were informative about the BOLD signal. In agreement with previous studies, gamma was the most informative band. Both increases and decreases in BOLD signal reliably followed increases and decreases in gamma power. However, both alpha and beta power signals carried information about BOLD that was largely complementary to that carried by gamma power. In particular, the relationship between alpha and gamma power was reflected in the amplitude of the BOLD signal, while the relationship between beta and gamma bands was reflected in the latency of BOLD with respect to significant changes in gamma power. These results lay the basis for identifying contributions of different neural pathways to cortical processing using fMRI.},

However, despite the prominent anatomical differences between cortical layers, little is known about the laminar pattern of spontaneous activity in V1. We address this topic by investigating the amplitude and coherence of ongoing local field potential (LFP) signals measured from different layers in V1 of macaque monkeys during rest and upon presentation of a visual stimulus. We used a linear microelectrode array to measure LFP signals at multiple, evenly spaced positions throughout the cortical thickness. Analyzing both the mean LFP amplitudes and between-contact LFP coherences, we identified two distinct zones of activity, roughly corresponding to superficial and deep layers, divided by a sharp transition near the bottom of layer 4. The LFP signals within each laminar zone were highly coherent, whereas those between zones were not. This functional compartmentalization was found not only during rest, but also when the receptive field was stimulated during a visual task. These results demonstrate the existence of distinct superficial and deep functional domains of coherent LFP activity in V1 that may reflect the intrinsic interplay of V1 microcircuitry with cortical and subcortical targets, respectively.},

abstract = {A local field potential (LFP) response can be measured throughout the visual cortex in response to the abrupt appearance of a visual stimulus. Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered ∼500 $\mu$m deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.},

abstract = {We report the results of our experimental and theoretical investigations of the neural response dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) during naturalistic visual stimulation. We recorded Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity from {\{}V1{\}} of anaesthetized macaques during binocular presentation of Hollywood color movies. We analyzed these recordings with information theoretic methods, and found that visual information was encoded mainly by two bands of {\{}LFP{\}} responses: the network fluctuations measured by the phase and power of low-frequency (less than 12 Hz) LFPs; and fast gamma-range (50–100 Hz) oscillations. Both the power and phase of low frequency {\{}LFPs{\}} carried information largely complementary to that carried by spikes, whereas gamma range oscillations carried information largely redundant to that of spikes. To interpret these results within a quantitative theoretical framework, we then simulated a sparsely connected recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons receiving slowly varying naturalistic inputs, and we determined how the {\{}LFPs{\}} generated by the network encoded information about the inputs. We found that this simulated recurrent network reproduced well the experimentally observed dependency of {\{}LFP{\}} information upon frequency. This network encoded the overall strength of the input into the power of gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory–excitatory neural interactions, and encoded slow variations in the input by entraining the network {\{}LFP{\}} at the corresponding frequency. This dynamical behavior accounted quantitatively for the independent information carried by high and low frequency LFPs, and for the experimentally observed cross-frequency coupling between phase of slow {\{}LFPs{\}} and the power of gamma LFPs. We also present new results showing that the model's dynamics also accounted for the extra visual information that the low-frequency {\{}LFP{\}} phase of spike firing carries beyond that carried by spike rates. Overall, our results suggest biological mechanisms by which cortex can multiplex information about naturalistic sensory environments.},

abstract = {Recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) reveal that the sensory cortex displays rhythmic activity and fluctuations over a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus-neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment.},

abstract = {This study examined the importance of the primate magnocellular retinocortical pathway in the perception of moving stimuli. A portion of the magnocellular pathway was permanently and selectively interrupted by ibotenic acid injections in the LGN of macaque monkeys. We then tested contrast sensitivity for detecting moving stimuli, as well as two indices of motion perception, contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination and speed difference thresholds, in the affected portion of the visual field. Magnocellular lesions greatly reduced detection contrast sensitivity at high temporal and low spatial frequencies and had a similar effect on contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination under these same stimulus conditions. Consequently, opposite direction discriminations could be made at contrast threshold, suggesting that magnocellular lesions reduced the visibility of stimuli used to test direction perception, but did not act directly on direction perception. Magnocellular lesions also elevated speed difference thresholds under some stimulus conditions. However, this deficit was reduced or eliminated by raising the contrast of the test stimulus. Together, these findings suggest that magnocellular lesions reduce the visibility of stimuli used to test motion perception but that they do not appear to alter motion perception otherwise.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal distributions of excitatory synaptic ensemble activities in A17 and A18 of the visual cortex of the macaque monkey have been investigated. The synaptic activities were elicited by electrical stimulation of the primary efferents and were localized by applying the current source density analysis to the intracortically recorded field potentials. The principal results are as follows: 1. In A17, two groups of activity, evoked by fast and slow afferents, respectively, were distinguishable. 2. The fast afferents induced monosynaptic activity in layer IV C alpha and layer VI, disynaptic activity in layer IV C alpha and in the supragranular layers and trisynaptic activity in layer IV B. 3. The slow efferents induced monosynaptic activity in lower layers IV C beta and layer VI, disynaptic activity via strong connections in upper layer IV C beta, further disynaptic activity in layers III and IV B and trisynaptic activity in layers V A and II. 4. With the exception that the CSD data reveal more polysynaptic activity within layer IV, there is good agreement between the spatio-temporal distribution of synaptic activities and the cortical circuit diagrams proposed in anatomical studies. 5. In A18, activities from the slow and fast conducting afferent systems are revealed in layer IV, both most likely mediated by the monosynaptically activated target cells of A17. These activities are passed on to the supra-and infragranular layers. 6. In the lateral geniculate nucleus the safety factor of transmission is higher for activity conveyed by slow-than by fast-conducting retinal afferents. 7. The spatial distribution of monocularly evoked surface potentials failed to reveal the ocular dominance columns. 8. Comparison with the cat indicates that, with respect to the intracortical circuitry and LHN-transmission, there are more similarities between the fast-group activity in the monkey and the y-system in the cat and between the slow-group activity in the monkey and the x-system in the cat than vice versa.},

abstract = {How and where hippocampal–neocortical interactions required for memory formation take place is a major issue of current research. Using a combined in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging/electrophysiology approach, we have investigated whether specific frequencies of CA3 neuronal activation, inducing different forms of short-term plasticity at CA1 synapses, contribute to differential activity propagation in brain-wide networks connected to the hippocampus. We report that localized activation of CA3 neurons in dorsal hippocampus produced activity propagation within the hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and entorhinal cortex, which increased monotonically with frequency to a maximum at 20–40 Hz. However, robust extrahippocampal propagation was seen specifically at theta–beta frequencies (10–20 Hz), reaching a network of midline neocortical and mesolimbic structures. Activation in those regions correlated with a frequency-dependent facilitation of spiking activity recorded in CA1. These results provide a mechanistic link between the dynamic properties of short-term plasticity in the efferent synapses of CA3 neurons in CA1 and activity propagation in brain-wide networks, and identify polysynaptic information channels segregated in the frequency domain.},

abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the so-called blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a powerful tool for studying brain function not only locally but also on the large scale. Most studies assume a simple relationship between neural and {\{}BOLD{\}} activity, in spite of the fact that it is important to elucidate how the “when” and “what” components of neural activity are correlated to the “where” of fMRI data. Here we conducted simultaneous recordings of neural and {\{}BOLD{\}} signal fluctuations in primary visual (V1) cortex of anesthetized monkeys. We explored the neurovascular relationship during periods of spontaneous activity by using temporal kernel canonical correlation analysis (tkCCA). tkCCA is a multivariate method that can take into account any features in the signals that univariate analysis cannot. The method detects filters in voxel space (for fMRI data) and in frequency–time space (for neural data) that maximize the neurovascular correlation without any assumption of a hemodynamic response function (HRF). Our results showed a positive neurovascular coupling with a lag of 4–5 s and a larger contribution from local field potentials (LFPs) in the $\gamma$ range than from low-frequency {\{}LFPs{\}} or spiking activity. The method also detected a higher correlation around the recording site in the concurrent spatial map, even though the pattern covered most of the occipital part of V1. These results are consistent with those of previous studies and represent the first multivariate analysis of intracranial electrophysiology and high-resolution fMRI.},

For the total cortical thickness, the average numerical density of neurons is approximately 120,000 per mm3 of tissue. This density increases and decreases in the different sublaminae in the direction that one would expect from the classical descriptions of Nissl-stained material (e.g., 137,000/mm3 in IVC alpha; 211,000/mm3 in IVC beta). There are about 200,000 neurons under 1 mm2 or cortical surface: 28{\%} are in layers I-III, 45{\%} are in layer IV, and 27{\%} are in layers V and VI. The total number in area 17 of one hemisphere is close to 160,000,000. For the total cortical thickness the numerical density of synapses is 276,000,000 per mm3 of tissue. Laminae with higher neuronal densities tend to have higher synaptic densities but the correlation is not perfectly concordant. Moreover, the changes in synaptic densities are not as great as those in neuronal densities so that laminae with higher neuronal densities have a lower synapse to neuron ratio and laminae with lower neuronal densities have a higher synapse to neuron ratio. For the total cortical thickness this ratio is 2,300 synapses per neuron (1,400 in layer IVC beta and 2,800 in layers II and III). There are 478 million synapses under 1 mm2 cortical surface: 40{\%} are in layers I-III, 35{\%} are in layer IV, and 25{\%} are in layers V and VI.

abstract = {"How is information decoded in the brain?" is one of the most difficult and important questions in neuroscience. We have developed a general framework for investigating to what extent the decoding process in the brain can be simplified. First, we hierarchically constructed simplified probabilistic models of neural responses that ignore more than Kth-order correlations using the maximum entropy principle. We then computed how much information is lost when information is decoded using these simplified probabilistic models (i.e., "mismatched decoders"). To evaluate the information obtained by mismatched decoders, we introduced an information theoretic quantity, I*, which was derived by extending the mutual information in terms of communication rate across a channel. We showed that I* provides consistent results with the minimum mean-square error as well as the mutual information, and demonstrated that a previously proposed measure quantifying the importance of correlations in decoding substantially deviates from I* when many cells are analyzed. We then applied this proposed framework to spike data for vertebrate retina using short natural scene movies of 100 ms duration as a set of stimuli and computing the information contained in neural activities. Although significant correlations were observed in population activities of ganglion cells, information loss was negligibly small even if all orders of correlation were ignored in decoding. We also found that, if we inappropriately assumed stationarity for long durations in the information analysis of dynamically changing stimuli, such as natural scene movies, correlations appear to carry a large proportion of total information regardless of their actual importance.},

abstract = {A new method for estimation of current-source density (CSD) from local field potentials is presented. This inverse CSD (iCSD) method is based on explicit inversion of the electrostatic forward solution and can be applied to data from multielectrode arrays with various geometries. Here, the method is applied to linear-array (laminar) electrode data. Three iCSD methods are considered: the CSD is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry and be (i) localized in infinitely thin discs, (ii) step-wise constant or (iii) continuous and smoothly varying (using cubic splines) in the vertical direction. For spatially confined CSD distributions the standard CSD method, involving a discrete double derivative, is seen in model calculations to give significant estimation errors when the lateral source dimension is comparable to the size of a cortical column (less than approximately 1 mm). Further, discontinuities in the extracellular conductivity are seen to potentially give sizable errors for even wider source distributions. The iCSD methods are seen to give excellent estimates when the correct lateral source dimension and spatial distribution of conductivity are incorporated.

abstract = {In the past decade, the cell-type specific connectivity and activity of local cortical networks have been characterized experimentally to some detail. In parallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure to activity dynamics. While the available connectivity maps have been used in various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings. Here, we show that the inconsistency arises from the incompleteness of the connectivity maps. Our comparison of the most comprehensive maps (Thomson et al., 2002; Binzegger et al., 2004) reveals their main discrepancies: the lateral sampling range and the specific selection of target cells. Taking them into account, we compile an integrated connectivity map and analyze the unified map by simulations of a full scale model of the local layered cortical network. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and the cell-type specific spontaneous firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. Similarly, the activation patterns evoked by transient thalamic inputs reproduce recent in vivo measurements. The correspondence of simulation results and experiments rests on the consideration of specific target type selection and thereby on the integration of a large body of the available connectivity data. The cell-type specific hierarchical input structure and the combination of feed-forward and feedback connections reveal how the interplay of excitation and inhibition shapes the spontaneous and evoked activity of the local cortical network.},

Our results show event-related theta and reveal a new phenomenon, the cognitive {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}gating{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} of a brain oscillation: at many cortical sites, the amplitude of theta oscillations increased dramatically at the start of the trial, continued through all phases of the trial, including the delay period, and decreased sharply at the end.

These results suggest that theta oscillations could have an important role in organizing multi-item working memory.},

abstract = {Primates actively examine the visual world by rapidly shifting gaze (fixation) over the elements in a scene. Despite this fact, we typically study vision by presenting stimuli with gaze held constant. To better understand the dynamics of natural vision, we examined how the onset of visual fixation affects ongoing neuronal activity in the absence of visual stimulation. We used multiunit activity and current source density measurements to index neuronal firing patterns and underlying synaptic processes in macaque V1. Initial averaging of neural activity synchronized to the onset of fixation suggested that a brief period of cortical excitation follows each fixation. Subsequent single-trial analyses revealed that 1) neuronal oscillation phase transits from random to a highly organized state just after the fixation onset, 2) this phase concentration is accompanied by increased spectral power in several frequency bands, and 3) visual response amplitude is enhanced at the specific oscillatory phase associated with fixation. We hypothesize that nonvisual inputs are used by the brain to increase cortical excitability at fixation onset, thus "priming" the system for new visual inputs generated at fixation. Despite remaining mechanistic questions, it appears that analysis of fixation-related responses may be useful in studying natural vision.},

It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

abstract = {Abstract A fundamental feature of the temporal organization of neural activity is phase-amplitude coupling between brain rhythms at different frequencies, where the amplitude of a higher frequency varies according to the phase of a lower frequency. Here, we show that this rule extends to brain-organ interactions. We measured both the infra-slow ({\~{}}0.05 Hz) rhythm intrinsically generated by the stomach – the gastric basal rhythm – using electrogastrography, and spontaneous brain dynamics with magnetoencephalography during resting-state with eyes open. We found significant phase-amplitude coupling between the infra-slow gastric phase and the amplitude of the cortical alpha rhythm (10–11 Hz), with gastric phase accounting for 8{\%} of the variance of alpha rhythm amplitude fluctuations. Gastric-alpha coupling was localized to the right anterior insula, and bilaterally to occipito-parietal regions. Transfer entropy, a measure of directionality of information transfer, indicates that gastric-alpha coupling is due to an ascending influence from the stomach to both the right anterior insula and occipito-parietal regions. Our results show that phase-amplitude coupling so far only observed within the brain extends to brain-viscera interactions. They further reveal that the temporal structure of spontaneous brain activity depends not only on neuron and network properties endogenous to the brain, but also on the slow electrical rhythm generated by the stomach.},

abstract = {Recent studies showed that the low-frequency component of local field potentials (LFPs) in monkey motor cortex carries information about parameters of voluntary arm movements. Here, we studied how different signal components of the LFP in the time and frequency domains are modulated during center-out arm movements. Analysis of LFPs in the time domain showed that the amplitude of a slow complex waveform beginning shortly before the onset of arm movement is modulated with the direction of the movement. Examining LFPs in the frequency domain, we found that direction-dependent modulations occur in three frequency ranges, which typically increased their amplitudes before and during movement execution: {\textless} or =4, 6-13, and 63-200 Hz. Cosine-like tuning was prominent in all signal components analyzed. In contrast, activity in a frequency band approximately 30 Hz was not modulated with the direction of movement and typically decreased its amplitude during the task. This suggests that high-frequency oscillations have to be divided into at least two functionally different regimes: one approximately 30 Hz and one {\textgreater}60 Hz. Furthermore, using multiple LFPs, we could show that LFP amplitude spectra can be used to decode movement direction, with the best performance achieved by the combination of different frequency ranges. These results suggest that using the different frequency components in the LFP is useful in improving inference of movement parameters from local field potentials.},

abstract = {We studied the steady-state orientation selectivity of single neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). To analyze the data, two measures of orientation tuning selectivity, circular variance and orientation bandwidth, were computed from the tuning curves. Circular variance is a global measure of the shape of the tuning curve, whereas orientation bandwidth is a local measure of the sharpness of the tuning curve around its peak. Circular variance in V1 was distributed broadly, indicating a great diversity of orientation selectivity. This diversity was also reflected in the individual cortical layers. However, there was a tendency for neurons with high circular variance, meaning low selectivity for orientation, to be concentrated in layers 4C, 3B, and 5. The relative variation of orientation bandwidth across the cortical layers was less than for circular variance, but it showed a similar laminar dependence. Neurons with large orientation bandwidth were found predominantly in layers 4C and 3B. There was a weak correlation between orientation selectivity and the level of spontaneous activity of the neurons. We also assigned a response modulation ratio for each cell, which is a measure of the linearity of spatial summation. Cells with low modulation ratios tended to have higher circular variance and bandwidth than those with high modulation ratios. These findings suggest a revision to the classical view that nonoriented receptive fields are principally found in layer 4C and the cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in layer 2/3. Instead, a broad distribution of tuning selectivity is found in all cortical layers, and neurons that are weakly tuned for orientation are ubiquitous in V1 cortex.},

abstract = {Intracortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reveal a system of periodically organized intrinsic connections in primate striate cortex. In layers 2 and 3 these connections form a reticular or latticelike pattern, extending for about 1.5-2.0 mm around an injection. This connectional lattice is composed of HRP-labeled walls (350-450 microns apart Saimiri and about 500-600 microns in macaque) surrounding unlabeled central lacunae. Within the lattice walls there are regularly arranged punctate loci of particularly dense HRP label, appearing as isolated patches as the lattice wall labeling thins further from the injection site. A periodic organization has also been demonstrated for the intrinsic connections in layer 4B, which are apparently in register with the supragranular periodicities, although separated from these by a thin unlabeled region. The 4B lattice is particularly prominent in squirrel monkey, extending for 2-3 mm from an injection. In both layers, these intrinsic connections are demonstrated by orthogradely and retrogradely transported HRP and seem to reflect a system of neurons with long horizontal axon collaterals, presumably with arborizations at regularly spaced intervals. The intrinsic connectional lattice in layers 2 and 3 resembles the repetitive array of cytochrome oxidase activity in these layers; but despite similarities of dimension and pattern, the two systems do not appear identical. In primate, as previously described in tree shrews (Rockland et al., '82), the HRP-labeled anatomical connections resemble the pattern of 2-deoxyglucose accumulation resulting from stimulation with oriented lines, although the functional importance of these connections remains obscure.},

Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

Identical procedures were carried out to assess latencies in each area, often in the same monkey, thereby permitting direct comparisons of timing across areas. This study presents the visual flash-evoked latencies for cells in areas where such data are common (V1 and V2), and are therefore a good standard, and also in areas where such data are sparse (LGNd M and P layers, MT, V4) or entirely lacking (V3, MST, and FEF in anesthetized preparation). Visual-evoked onset latencies were, on average, 17 ms shorter in the LGNd M layers than in the LGNd P layers. Visual responses occurred in V1 before any other cortical area. The next wave of activation occurred concurrently in areas V3, MT, MST, and FEF. Visual response latencies in areas V2 and V4 were progressively later and more broadly distributed. These differences in the time course of activation across the dorsal and ventral streams provide important temporal constraints on theories of visual processing.},

abstract = {We investigated the spatiotemporal activation pattern, produced by one visual stimulus, across cerebral cortical regions in awake monkeys. Laminar profiles of postsynaptic potentials and action potentials were indexed with current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity profiles respectively. Locally, we found contrasting activation profiles in dorsal and ventral stream areas. The former, like V1 and V2, exhibit a 'feedforward' profile, with excitation beginning at the depth of Lamina 4, followed by activation of the extragranular laminae. The latter often displayed a multilaminar/columnar profile, with initial responses distributed across the laminae and reflecting modulation rather than excitation; CSD components were accompanied by either no changes or by suppression of action potentials. System-wide, response latencies indicated a large dorsal/ventral stream latency advantage, which generalizes across a wide range of methods. This predicts a specific temporal ordering of dorsal and ventral stream components of visual analysis, as well as specific patterns of dorsal-ventral stream interaction. Our findings support a hierarchical model of cortical organization that combines serial and parallel elements. Critical in such a model is the recognition that processing within a location typically entails multiple temporal components or 'waves' of activity, driven by input conveyed over heterogeneous pathways from the retina.},

It is consistent with the cellular and synaptic anatomy of Area 17: initial activation of the thalamorecipient subdivisions of Lamina 4C, followed by activation of mid/upper Lamina 4 and of supra- and infragranular laminae.

abstract = {Two fundamental requirements for multisensory integration are convergence of unisensory (e.g. visual and auditory) inputs and temporal alignment of the neural responses to convergent inputs. We investigated the anatomic mechanisms of multisensory convergence by examining three areas in which convergence occurs, posterior auditory association cortex, superior temporal polysensory area (STP) and ventral intraparietal sulcus area (VIP). The first of these was recently shown to be a site of multisensory convergence and the latter two are more well known as 'classic' multisensory regions. In each case, we focused on defining the laminar profile of response to the unisensory inputs. This information is useful because two major types of connection, feedforward and feedback, have characteristic differences in laminar termination patterns, which manifest physiologically. In the same multisensory convergence areas we also examined the timing of the unisensory inputs using the same standardized stimuli across all recordings. Our findings indicate that: (1) like somatosensory input [J. Neurophysiol., 85 (2001) 1322], visual input is available at very early stages of auditory processing, (2) convergence occurs through feedback, as well as feedforward anatomical projections and (3) input timing may be an asset, as well as a constraint in multisensory processing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings. RESULTS: We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers {\~{}}70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, {\~{}}30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.},

abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide a critical link between the hemodynamic response, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the dynamics of the underlying neuronal activity. Single-trial ERP recordings capture the oscillatory activity that are hypothesized to underlie both communication between brain regions and amplified processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, precise interpretations of ERPs are precluded by uncertainty about their neural mechanisms. One influential theory holds that averaged sensory ERPs are generated by partial phase resetting of ongoing electroencephalographic oscillations, while another states that ERPs result from stimulus-evoked neural responses. We formulated critical predictions of each theory and tested these using direct, intracortical analyses of neural activity in monkeys. Our findings support a predominant role for stimulus-evoked activity in sensory ERP generation, and they outline both logic and methodology necessary for differentiating evoked and phase resetting contributions to cognitive and motor ERPs in future studies.},

Vos (1978), while being consistent with a linear combination of the A. Stockman {\&} L. T. Sharpe (2000) long-wavelength-sensitive (L) and middle-wavelength-sensitive (M) cone fundamentals. It is based on experimentally determined 25 Hz, 2 degrees diameter, heterochromatic (minimum) flicker photometric data obtained from 40 observers (35 males, 5 females) of known genotype, 22 with the serine variant L(ser180), 16 with the alanine L(ala180) variant, and 2 with both variants of the L-cone photopigment. The matches, from 425 to 675 nm in 5-nm steps, were made on a 3 log troland xenon white (correlated color temperature of 5586 K but tritanopically metameric with CIE D65 standard daylight for the Stockman and Sharpe L- and M-cone fundamentals in quantal units) adapting field of 16 degrees angular subtense, relative to a 560-nm standard. Both the reference standard and test lights were kept near flicker threshold so that, in the region of the targets, the total retinal illuminance averaged 3.19 log trolands. The advantages of the new function are as follows: it forms a consistent set with the new proposed CIE cone fundamentals (which are the Stockman {\&} Sharpe 2000 cone fundamentals); it is based solely on flicker photometry, which is the standard method for defining luminance; it corresponds to a central 2 degrees viewing field, for which the basic laws of brightness matching are valid for flicker photometry; its composition of the serine/alanine L-cone pigment polymorphism (58:42) closely matches the reported incidence in the normal population (56:44; Stockman {\&} Sharpe, 1999); and it specifies luminance for a reproducible, standard daylight condition. V*(lambda) is defined as 1.55L(lambda) + M(lambda), where L(lambda) and M(lambda) are the Stockman {\&} Sharpe L- {\&} M-cone (quantal) fundamentals. It is extrapolated to wavelengths shorter than 425 nm and longer than 675 nm using the Stockman {\&} Sharpe cone fundamentals.},

In addition, we show that prefrontal neurons phase lock best to theta oscillations delayed by approximately 50 ms and confirm this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level of correlations between single cells. Finally, we find that phase locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms. The theta-entrained activity across cortico-hippocampal circuits described here may be important for gating information flow and guiding the plastic changes that are believed to underlie the storage of information across these networks.},

However, the information content of these perceptual moments remains a critical challenge to the understanding of consciousness. We uncovered this information content in four observers who consciously perceived each interpretation of the ambiguous Dali painting Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire. For each individual observer, we isolated the stimulus spatial frequency (SF) features underlying their overt judgments of the input as "the nuns" and "Voltaire". Every 2 ms between stimulus onset and overt response, we derived the sensitivity of the observer's oscillatory brain activity (in the theta, alpha, and beta bandwidths) to these SF features. Then, in each bandwidth, we estimated the moments (between stimulus onset and perceptual judgment) when perception-specific SF features were maximally integrated, corresponding to perceptual moments. We show that the centroparietal beta oscillations support perceptual moments underlying the conscious perception of the nuns, whereas theta oscillations support the perception of Voltaire. For both perceptions, we reveal the specific information content of these perceptual moments.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses are correlated on a range of timescales. Correlations can affect population coding and may play an important role in cortical function. Correlations are known to depend on stimulus drive, behavioral context, and experience, but the mechanisms that determine their properties are poorly understood. Here we make use of the laminar organization of cortex, with its variations in sources of input, local circuit architecture, and neuronal properties, to test whether networks engaged in similar functions but with distinct properties generate different patterns of correlation. We find that slow timescale correlations are prominent in the superficial and deep layers of primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys, but near zero in the middle layers. Brief timescale correlation (synchrony), on the other hand, was slightly stronger in the middle layers of V1, although evident at most cortical depths. Laminar variations were also apparent in the power of the local field potential, with a complementary pattern for low frequency ({\textless}10 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) power. Recordings in area V2 revealed a laminar dependence similar to V1 for synchrony, but slow timescale correlations were not different between the input layers and nearby locations. Our results reveal that cortical circuits in different laminae can generate remarkably different patterns of correlations, despite being tightly interconnected.},

abstract = {Although the mammalian neocortex has a clear laminar organization, layer-specific neuronal computations remain to be uncovered. Several studies suggest that gamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is produced in granular and superficial layers and is associated with the processing of visual input. Oscillatory alpha band activity in deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability associated with changes in arousal and cognitive factors. To investigate the layer-specific interplay between these two phenomena, we characterized the coupling between alpha and gamma band activity of the local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Using multicontact laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from all layers of V1, we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper layers and gamma amplitude in granular and superficial layers. Moreover, the power in the two frequency bands was anticorrelated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate robust interlaminar cross-frequency coupling in the visual cortex, supporting the view that neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range phasically modulates processing in the cortical microcircuit in a top-down manner.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the phase of low-frequency local field potentials (LFPs) in sensory cortices carries a significant amount of information about complex naturalistic stimuli, yet the laminar circuit mechanisms and the aspects of stimulus dynamics responsible for generating this phase information remain essentially unknown. Here we investigated these issues by means of an information theoretic analysis of LFPs and current source densities (CSDs) recorded with laminar multi-electrode arrays in the primary auditory area of anesthetized rats during complex acoustic stimulation (music and broadband 1/f stimuli). We found that most LFP phase information originated from discrete {\&}ldquo;CSD events{\&}rdquo; consisting of granular{\&}ndash;superficial layer dipoles of short duration and large amplitude, which we hypothesize to be triggered by transient thalamocortical activation. These CSD events occurred at rates of 2{\&}ndash;4 Hz during both stimulation with complex sounds and silence.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the phase of low-frequency local field potentials (LFPs) in sensory cortices carries a significant amount of information about complex naturalistic stimuli, yet the laminar circuit mechanisms and the aspects of stimulus dynamics responsible for generating this phase information remain essentially unknown. Here we investigated these issues by means of an information theoretic analysis of LFPs and current source densities (CSDs) recorded with laminar multi-electrode arrays in the primary auditory area of anesthetized rats during complex acoustic stimulation (music and broadband 1/f stimuli). We found that most LFP phase information originated from discrete {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}CSD events{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} consisting of granular{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}superficial layer dipoles of short duration and large amplitude, which we hypothesize to be triggered by transient thalamocortical activation.

During stimulation with complex sounds, these events reliably reset the LFP phases at specific times during the stimulation history.

abstract = {We present a generalized reverse correlation technique that can be used to estimate the spatio-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) of sensory neurons from their responses to arbitrary stimuli such as auditory vocalizations or natural visual scenes. The general solution for STRF estimation requires normalization of the stimulus-response cross-correlation by the stimulus autocorrelation matrix. When the second-order stimulus statistics are stationary, normalization involves only the diagonal elements of the Fourier-transformed auto-correlation matrix (the power spectrum). In the non-stationary case normalization requires the entire auto-correlation matrix. We present modelling studies that demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method as well as neurophysiological data comparing STRFs estimated using natural versus synthetic stimulus ensembles. For both auditory and visual neurons, STRFs obtained with these different stimuli are similar, but exhibit systematic differences that may be functionally significant. This method should be useful for determining what aspects of natural signals are represented by sensory neurons and may reveal novel response properties of these neurons.},

abstract = {This review aims to summarize data obtained with different techniques to provide a functional map of the local circuit connections made by neocortical neurones, a reference for those interested in cortical circuitry and the numerical information required by those wishing to model the circuit. A brief description of the main techniques used to study circuitry is followed by outline descriptions of the major classes of neocortical excitatory and inhibitory neurones and the connections that each layer makes with other cortical and subcortical regions. Maps summarizing the projection patterns of each class of neurone within the local circuit and tables of the properties of these local circuit connections are provided. This review relies primarily on anatomical studies that have identified the classes of neurones and their local and long distance connections and on paired intracellular and whole-cell recordings which have documented the properties of the connections between them. A large number of different types of synaptic connections have been described, but for some there are only a few published examples and for others the details that can only be obtained with paired recordings and dye-filling are lacking. A further complication is provided by the range of species, technical approaches and age groups used in these studies. Wherever possible the range of available data are summarised and compared. To fill some of the more obvious gaps for the less well-documented cases, data obtained with other methods are also summarized.},

Patterns of connectivity and synaptic properties were similar in the two species, although differences of scale and in the range of morphologies were observed. Excitatory 'forward' projections from layer 4 to 3, like those from layer 3 to 5, targeted pyramidal cells and a small proportion of interneurons, while excitatory 'back' projections from layer 3 to 4 selected interneurons, including parvalbumin immuno-positive basket cells. Layer 4 interneurons that inhibited layer 3 pyramidal cells included both basket cells and dendrite-targeting cells. Large interneurons, resembling cells previously described as large basket cells, in layers 4 and 3 (cat), with long myelinated horizontal axon collaterals received frequent excitatory inputs from both layers. A very high rate of connectivity was observed between pairs of interneurons, often with quite different morphologies, and the resultant IPSPs, like the EPSPs recorded in interneurons, were brief compared with those recorded in pyramidal and spiny stellate cells.},

abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler distance-a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions-and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

abstract = {This study identifies fundamental anatomical features of primary visual cortex, area V1 of macaque monkey cerebral cortex, i.e., features that are present in area V1 of phylogenetically distant mammals of quite different lifestyle and features that are common to other regions of cortex. We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of V1 cortex between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque primary visual cortex rather than convergent evolution of these features.},

abstract = {A double-label deoxyglucose technique was used to study orientation columns throughout visual cortex in awake behaving macaques. Four macaques were trained to fixate while contrastreversing, stationary gratings or one-dimensional noise of a single orientation or an orthogonal orientation were presented, during uptake of [14C]deoxyglucose ([14C]DG) or [3H]DG, respectively. The two orthogonal stimulus orientations produced DG-labeled columns that were maximally separated in the two isotope maps (inter-digitated) in four areas: V1, V2, V3 and VP. The topographic change from interdigitated to overlapping columns occurred abruptly rather than gradually, at corresponding cortical area borders (e.g. VP and V4v, respectively). In addition, the data suggest that orientation column topography systematically changes with retinotopic eccentricity. In V1, the orientation columns systematically avoided the cytochrome oxidase blobs in the parafoveal representation, but converged closer to the blobs in the foveal representation. A control experiment indicated that this was unlikely to reflect eccentricity-dependent differences in cortical spatial frequency sensitivity. A similar eccentricity-dependent change in the topography of orientation columns occurred in V2. In parafoveal but not foveal visual field representations of V2, the orientation columns were centered on the thick cytochrome oxidase stripes, extended into the adjacent interstripe region, but were virtually absent in the thin stripes.},

abstract = {1. We recorded local field potentials in the parafoveal representation in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized and paralyzed macaque monkeys with a multicontact electrode that provided for sampling of neural activity at 16 sites along a vertical penetration. Differential recordings at adjacent contacts were transformed into an estimate of current source density (CSD), to provide a measure of local neural activity. 2. We used m-sequence stimuli to map the region of visual space that provided input to the recording site. The local field potential recorded in macaque V1 has a population receptive field (PRF) size of approximately 2 deg2. 3. We assessed spatial tuning by the responses to two-dimensional Gaussian noise, spatially filtered to retain power only within one octave. Responses to achromatic band-limited noise stimuli revealed a prominent band-pass spatial tuning in the upper layers, but a more low-pass spatial tuning in lower layers. 4. We assessed orientation tuning by the responses to band-limited noise whose spectrum was further restricted to lie within 45 degrees wedges. The local field potential showed evidence of orientation tuning at most sites. Orientation tuning in upper and lower layers was manifest by systematic variations not only in response size but also in response dynamics. 5. We assessed chromatic tuning by the responses to isotropic band-limited noise modulated in a variety of directions in tristimulus space. Some lower-layer locations showed a nulling of response under near-isoluminant conditions. However, response dynamics in upper and lower layers depended not only on luminance contrast, but also on chromatic inputs. 6. Responses to near-isoluminant stimuli and to low-contrast luminance modulation were shifted to lower spatial frequencies. 7. We determined the extent to which various temporal frequencies in the response conveyed information concerning spatial frequency, orientation, and color under the steady-state conditions used in these studies. In each case, information is distributed in the response dynamics across a broad temporal frequency range, beginning at 4 Hz (the lowest frequency used). For spatial frequency the information rate remains significant up to at least 25 Hz. For orientation tuning and chromatic tuning, the information rate is lower overall and remains significant up to 13 Hz. In contrast, for texture discrimination, information is shifted to lower temporal frequencies.},

abstract = {The use of photographs, slides, computerized images, and video to study behavior is increasingly being employed in nonhuman primates. However, since these mediums have been designed to simulate natural coloration for normal trichromatic human vision, they can fail to reproduce color in meaningful and accurate ways for viewers with different visual systems. Given the range of color perception that exists both across and within different species, it is necessary to consider this variation in order to discern the suitability of these mediums for experimental use. Because of the high degree of visual similarity among humans, Old World monkeys, and apes, the use of photographic and video stimuli should be acceptable in terms of replicating naturalistic coloration and making noticeable color manipulations. However, among New World primates and prosimians, there exists a considerable degree of variation in color perceptual abilities depending on the species, sex, and allelic combination of the animals involved. Therefore, the use of these mediums to study behavior is problematic for these species, and should be done with caution. Am. J.

The simplest approach is to substitute local averages (LA) in place of missing data. A more elaborate alternative is to estimate a smaller number of CSD parameters than the actual number of recordings and to take the least-squares fit (LS). We compare the two approaches in the three-dimensional case on several sets of surrogate and experimental data, for varying numbers of missing data points, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. One can construct CSD distributions for which one or the other approach is better. However, in general, the LA method is to be recommended as being more stable and more robust to variations in the recorded fields.},

abstract = {Relationships between the M and P retino-geniculo-cortical visual pathways and {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}dorsal{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} visual areas were investigated by measuring the sources of local excitatory input to individual neurons in layer 4B of primary visual cortex. We found that contributions of the M and P pathways to layer 4B neurons are dependent on cell type. Spiny stellate neurons receive strong M input through layer 4C$\alpha$ and no significant P input through layer 4C$\beta$. In contrast, pyramidal neurons in layer 4B receive strong input from both layers 4C$\alpha$ and 4C$\beta$. These observations, along with evidence that direct input from layer 4B to area MT arises predominantly from spiny stellates, suggest that these different cell types constitute two functionally specialized subsystems.},

@article{Yedlin1974,
abstract = {Electrical conductivity in molecular and granular layers of cat cerebellar cortex is studied, taking into account anisotropy. A suitable mathematical analysis involving a Green's function approach gives an equation relating voltage to three principal variables: the magnitude of the point current source, the distance from the source, and the conductivities in each of three orthogonal directions. Voltage is measured experimentally as a function of distance in the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum. The results of these measurements are used to provide an empiric fit to the derived equations. From a set of parameters obtained from the fitted curves, the electrical conductivities are calculated. Sample values of the conductivities are used for three dimensional plots of voltage as a function of two space coordinates, to show the degree of anisotropy in two of the three directions. Results indicate that the conductivities for each direction in the granular layer are all of the order of 2.0 mmho/cm. In the molecular layer, the conductivity in two directions is about 3.0 mmho/cm, but in the other direction it is 1.7 mmho/cm. The granular layer is more isotropic than the molecular layer due to structural differences between the two layers.},

abstract = {The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is the most commonly used modality of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) today. Although easy to implement, it is an ambiguous signal since it results from a combination of several hemodynamic factors. Functional cerebral blood flow changes, as measured by using arterial spin labeling (ASL), typically occur in the parenchyma and have been demonstrated to be more closely coupled to neural activation compared with BOLD. However, the intrinsically low signals from ASL techniques have hindered its widespread application to fMRI for basic research and even more so for clinical applications. Here, we report the first implementation of continuous ASL in the anaesthetized macaque at high magnetic field of 7T. The technique was optimized to permit maximum signal-to-noise ratio of functional perfusion-based images at high spatial resolution. The effect of labeling parameters, such as label time and post-label delay (PLD), on functional cerebral blood flow (fCBF) in the visual cortex was evaluated. Functional cerebral blood flow maps did not change with increasing label time after 2,000 ms, indicating that a label time of 2,000 ms is sufficient for reliable mapping of fCBF. The percent changes obtained using fCBF were better localized to gray matter, than those obtained with BOLD. A short PLD of 200 ms revealed significantly higher fCBF changes at the cortical surface, indicating large-vessel contamination, than a long PLD of 800 ms. However, the effect of the PLD on fCBF was smaller than on baseline CBF. These results are of importance for high-resolution applications, and when accurate quantification is required for studies in monkeys as well as in humans.},

abstract = {Ascending sensory inputs arriving in layer 1 of the neocortex carry crucial signals for detecting salient information; but how the inputs are processed in layer 1 is unknown. Using a whole-cell in vivo recording technique targeting nonpyramidal neurons in layer 1 and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in layers 1-2, we examined the processing of these ascending sensory inputs in the barrel cortex. Here, we show that local circuit and deeper-layer-projecting neurons in layer 1, as well as tuft dendrites and somata of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, respond to multiple whiskers (6-15) with robust EPSPs. Remarkably, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses is as short as approximately 5-7 msec in layer 1 neurons and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In addition, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses in tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is approximately 1 msec shorter than that in somata. These results indicate that ascending sensory inputs arrive in layers 1 and 4 concurrently, which provides a neural mechanism for rapid integration and coincident detection of salient sensory information.},
